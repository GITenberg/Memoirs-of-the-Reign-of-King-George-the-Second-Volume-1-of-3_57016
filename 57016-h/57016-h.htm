<hr class="r10" />

<p>The work now submitted to the public is printed
from a Manuscript of the late Horace Walpole,
Earl of Orford.</p>

<p>Among the papers found at Strawberry Hill,
after the death of Lord Orford, was the following
Memorandum, wrapped in an envelope, on which was
written, “Not to be opened till after my Will.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In my Library at Strawberry Hill are two
wainscot chests or boxes, the larger marked with
an A, the lesser with a B. I desire, that as soon
as I am dead, my Executor and Executrix will
cord up strongly and seal the larger box, marked
A, and deliver it to the Honourable Hugh Conway
Seymour, to be kept by him unopened and unsealed
till the eldest son of Lady Waldegrave, or whichever
of her sons, being Earl of Waldegrave, shall attain
the age of twenty-five years; when the said chest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
with whatever it contains, shall be delivered to him
for his own. And I beg that the Honourable Hugh
Conway Seymour, when he shall receive the said
chest, will give a promise in writing, signed by him,
to Lady Waldegrave, that he or his Representatives
will deliver the said chest unopened and unsealed,
by my Executor and Executrix, to the first son of
Lady Waldegrave who shall attain the age of
twenty-five years. The key of the said chest is in
one of the cupboards of the Green Closet, within
the Blue Breakfast Room, at Strawberry Hill, and
that key, I desire, may be delivered to Laura, Lady
Waldegrave, to be kept by her till her son shall
receive the chest.</p>

<p class="right">
(Signed) “<span class="smcap">Hor. Walpole</span>, Earl of Orford.</p>

<p class="fs80">“August 19, 1796.”</p></div>

<p>In obedience to these directions, the box described
in the preceding Memorandum was corded and
sealed with the seals of the Honourable Mrs. Damer
and the late Lord Frederick Campbell, the Executrix
and Executor of Lord Orford, and by them delivered
to the late Lord Hugh Seymour, by whose
Representatives it was given up, unopened and unsealed,
to the present Earl of Waldegrave, when he
attained the age of twenty-five. On examining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
box, it was found to contain a number of manuscript
volumes and other papers, among which were
the Memoirs now published.</p>

<p>Though no directions were left by Lord Orford
for the publication of these Memoirs, there can be
little doubt of his intention that they should one
day or other be communicated to the world. Innumerable
passages in the Memoirs show they were
written for the public. The precautions of the
Author to preserve them for a certain number of
years from inspection, are a proof, not of his intention
that they should remain always in the private
hands of his family, but of his fears lest, if divulged,
they might be published prematurely; and the term
fixed for opening the chest seems to mark the distance
of time when he thought they might be made
public without impropriety. Ten years have elapsed
since that period, and more than sixty years since
the last of the historical events he commemorates
in this work.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> No man is now alive whose character
or conduct is the subject of praise or censure in
these Memoirs.</p>

<p>The printed correspondence of Lord Orford contains
allusions to this work. In a letter written in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
1752,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he informs Mr. Montagu, that “his Memoirs
of last year are quite finished,” but that he
means to “add some pages of notes that will not
want anecdotes;” and in answer to that gentleman,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
who had threatened him in jest with a Messenger
from the Secretary’s Office to seize his papers, after
a ludicrous account of the alarm into which he had
been thrown by the actual arrival of a King’s Messenger
at his door, he adds, “however, I have
buried the Memoirs under the oak in my garden,
where they are to be found a thousand years hence,
and taken, perhaps, for a Runic history in rhyme.”</p>

<p>The Postscript, printed in this edition at the
end of the Preface, but annexed by the Author to
his Memoirs of the year 1751, evidently implies,
that what he had then written was destined for publication.
It is addressed in the usual style of an
author to his reader, and contains an answer to objections
that might be made to him. In this answer
or apology for his work he justifies the freedom of
his strictures on public men, vindicates the impartiality
of his characters and narrative, claims the
merit of care and fidelity in his reports of parliamentary
proceedings, and explains the sources of
information from which he derived his knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>of the many private anecdotes and transactions he
relates.</p>

<p>In the beginning of his Memoirs of 1752, he
again speaks of his work as one ultimately destined
for the public. “I sit down,” he says, “to resume
a task, for which I fear Posterity will condemn the
Author, at the same time that they feel their
curiosity gratified.”</p>

<p>Many other passages might be quoted that imply
he wrote for Posterity, with an intention that at
some future time his work should be given to the
public. “These sheets,” he remarks, “were less
intended for a history of war than for civil annals.
Whatever tends to a knowledge of the characters
of remarkable persons, of the manners of the age,
and of its political intrigues, comes properly within
my plan. I am more attentive to deserve the
thanks of Posterity than their admiration.”&mdash;“I
am no historian,” he observes in another place; “I
write casual memoirs, I draw characters, I preserve
anecdotes, which my superiors, the historians of
Britain, may enchase into their mighty annals, or
pass over at pleasure.”&mdash;“To be read for a few
years is immortality enough for such a writer as
me.”&mdash;“Posterity, this is an impartial picture.”</p>

<p>At the conclusion of his Memoirs of 1758, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
the Author makes a pause in his work, and seems
uncertain whether he should ever resume it or not,
he again addresses himself to his readers in the style
of an author looking forward to publication. If he
should ever continue his work, he warns his readers
“not to expect so much intelligence and information
in any of the subsequent pages as may have appeared
in the preceding.”&mdash;“During the former
period,” he goes on to observe, “I lived in the
centre of business, was intimately acquainted with
many of the chief actors, was eager in politics, indefatigable
in heaping up knowledge and materials
for my work. Now, detached from these busy
scenes, with many political connexions dropped or
dissolved, indifferent to events, and indolent, I
shall have fewer opportunities of informing myself
or others.”</p>

<p>He then proceeds to give a character of himself,
and to “lay open to his readers his nearest sentiments.”
He acknowledges some enmities and resentments,
confesses that he has been injured by
some, and treated by others with ingratitude, but
assures his readers, as he probably thought himself,
that he has written without bias or partiality,
“that affection and veneration for truth and justice
have preponderated above all other considerations,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and that when he has expressed himself of particular
men with a severity that may appear objectionable,
it was “the unamiableness of the characters
he blames that imprinted the dislikes,” to
which he pleads guilty. Can it be supposed, he
asks, that “he would sacrifice the integrity of these
Memoirs, <em>his favourite labour</em>, to a little revenge
that he shall never taste?” Whatever may be
thought of the soundness of this reasoning, and
whatever opinion may be formed of the impartiality
of his work, it seems impossible that anything
short of a positive injunction to commit his Memoirs
to the Press could have conveyed a stronger
indication of the intention and desire of the Author,
that, at some future period after his decease, this
<em>his favourite labour</em> should be communicated to
the public.</p>

<p>The extraordinary pains taken by Lord Orford
to correct and improve his Memoirs, and prepare
them for publication, afford no less convincing proof
of his intentions in the legacy of his work. The
whole of the Memoirs now published have been
written over twice, and the early part three times.
The first sketches or foul copies of the work are in
his own hand-writing; then follows what he calls
the corrected and transcribed copy, which is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
written by himself; and this third or last copy,
extending to the end of 1755, is written by his
secretary or amanuensis, Mr. Kirkgate, with some
corrections by himself, and the notes on the blank
pages, opposite to the fair copy, entirely in his own
hand. This last copy was bound into two regular
volumes, with etchings from designs furnished by
Bentley and Muntz, to serve as a frontispiece to
the whole work, and as head-pieces for each chapter,
explanations of which were subjoined at the end.</p>

<p>So much for the authenticity of the present
work, and obvious intention of the Author that
after a sufficient lapse of years it should be published.
Of the Author himself, so well known by
his numerous publications, little need be said, except
to give the dates of his entrance into Parliament,
and of his retirement from public life, with
some few observations on his political character
and connexions.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole, afterwards Earl of Orford, was
third son of the celebrated Sir Robert Walpole.
He was born on the 5th of October, 1717, and
brought into Parliament in 1741, for the borough
of Callington. At the general election in 1747, he
was returned a second time for the same borough;
and in 1754 he came into Parliament for Castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
Rising. On the death of his uncle, Lord Walpole,
of Wolterton, in 1757, he accepted the Chiltern
Hundreds, in order to succeed his cousin, become
Lord Walpole, in the representation of Lynn Regis,
“the Corporation of which had such reverence for
his father’s memory, that they would not bear distant
relations while he had sons living.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> At the
general election for 1761, he was again returned
for Lynn without opposition; but being threatened
with a contested election, and heartily tired of politics,
from which he had in a great measure withdrawn
after the accession of his friends to office in
1765, he voluntarily retired from Parliament in
1768. In 1791 he succeeded his nephew as Earl
of Orford, and died on the 2nd of March, 1797, in
the eightieth year of his age.</p>

<p>The House of Commons, in which Mr. Walpole
first sat, was the one that overturned his father’s
Administration. In the very first week of the session,
the Minister was left in a minority. He still,
however, kept his place, and so nearly were parties
balanced, that for two months he maintained, with
alternate victories and reverses, a contest with his
adversaries. At length, secretly betrayed by some
of his colleagues, who had entered into private engagements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
with his enemies, and defeated in an
election question, which had been made a trial of
strength between Ministry and Opposition, he retired
from office, and became Earl of Orford.</p>

<p>His son Horace, though exempt from ambition,
was roused by his father’s danger, and, while the
struggle lasted, took a lively interest in all that
passed. In his letters, he gives an entertaining
and not uncandid account of the Debates that
took place, and communicates freely to his Correspondent
the hopes and fears, the good and bad
success of his party; his anticipations of their
strength in the different questions as they arose, are
followed by his explanations of their failures, as
far as he could account for them at the time; the
desertion and falling off of their friends are stigmatized
as they occurred, with the severity such
conduct deserved; and when Sir Robert was compelled
to resign, his son records with satisfaction
the successful efforts used to secure him from the
vengeance of his enemies, by disuniting the parties
coalesced against him, and rendering them odious
to the public, and hostile to one another.</p>

<p>But, though assiduous in his attendance on Parliament
during this period, and sincerely anxious
for his father, Mr. Walpole, who had no turn for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
public speaking, once and once only addressed the
House. It was on a motion of Lord Limerick,
seconded by Sir John St. Aubin, to appoint a Committee
of Inquiry into the conduct of Robert, Earl
of Orford, during the last ten years of his Administration.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
A similar motion to inquire generally
into the conduct of affairs at home and abroad for
the last twenty, had been made and rejected a fortnight
before.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The selection of this occasion for
his maiden speech, did credit to the judgment and
feelings of Mr. Walpole; and, though there is little
force in his arguments against the motion, there is
modesty, right feeling, and some happiness, both of
thought and expression, in what he said. The
speech, as he delivered it, is preserved in his Correspondence;
and as it has no sort of resemblance
to the speech published in his name by the London
Magazine, and since reprinted in the Parliamentary
History, we subjoin it for the satisfaction of our
readers. The report of it, given by Mr. Walpole
himself the day after it was made, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pad2">“Mr. Speaker,</p>

<p>“I have always thought, Sir, that incapacity and
inexperience must prejudice the cause they undertake
to defend; and it has been diffidence of myself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>not distrust of the cause, that has hitherto made
me so silent upon a point on which I ought to have
appeared so zealous.</p>

<p>“While the attempts for this inquiry were made
in general terms, I should have thought it presumption
in me to stand up and defend measures
in which so many abler men have been engaged,
and which, consequently, they could so much better
support: but when the attack grows more personal,
it grows my duty to oppose it more particularly;
lest I be suspected of an ingratitude, which my
heart disdains. But I think, Sir, I cannot be suspected
of that, unless my not having abilities to
defend my father can be construed into a desire not
to defend him.</p>

<p>“My experience, Sir, is very small; I have never
been conversant in business and politics, and have
sat a very short time in this House. With so slight
a fund, I must mistrust my power to serve him,
especially as in the short time I have sat here, I
have seen that not his own knowledge, innocence,
and eloquence, have been able to protect him against
a powerful and determined party. I have seen,
since his retirement, that he has many great and
noble friends, who have been able to protect him
from farther violence. But, Sir, when no repulses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
can calm the clamour against him, no motives should
sway his friends from openly undertaking his defence.
When the King has conferred rewards on his services;
when the Parliament has refused its assent
to any inquiries of complaint against him, it is but
maintaining the King’s and our own honour to
reject this Motion, for the repeating which, however,
I cannot think the authors to blame, as I suppose,
now they have turned him out, they are
willing to inquire whether they had any reason
to do so.</p>

<p>“I shall say no more, Sir, but leave the material
part of this defence to the impartiality, candour,
and credit of men who are no ways dependent on
him. He has already found that defence, Sir, and
I hope he always will. It is to their authority I
trust; and to me it is the strongest proof of innocence,
that for twenty years together no crime could
be solemnly alleged against him; and, since his
dismission, he has seen a majority rise up to defend
his character, in that very House of Commons in
which a majority had overturned his power. As,
therefore, Sir, I must think him innocent, I must
stand up to protect him from injustice&mdash;had he been
accused, I should not have given the House this
trouble; but I think, Sir, that the precedent of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
was done upon this question a few days ago, sufficient
reason, if I had no other, for me to give my negative
now.”</p></div>

<p>This speech of a son, in defence of his father,
appears to have been well received by the House.
Mr. Pitt, who was at that time one of the most
violent against Lord Orford, said in reply, “How
very commendable it was in Mr. Walpole to have
made the above speech, which must have made an
impression on the House; but, if it was becoming
in him to remember that he was the child of
the accused, the House ought to remember, too,
that they are the children of their country.” “It
was a great compliment from him,” adds Mr. Walpole,
“and very artful, too.” The Motion was
carried by a majority of 252 to 245. Nothing was
made of the inquiry.</p>

<p>For many years after the fall of Lord Orford,
Mr. Walpole took an active part in all the political
intrigues and dissensions of the times. Though he
had not been treated, as he frequently hints, with
any great kindness or indulgence by his father, he
was indignant at the persecution against him, and
appears to have been warmly and affectionately
attached to his memory. In his private correspondence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
he continually alludes to the mild and
prudent policy of Sir Robert, and contrasts it with
the violence and rashness of succeeding Ministers;
and, as he advanced in life, these impressions
became stronger, and recur more frequently in his
writings. His political connexions were originally
with his father’s friends; and for many years
he appears to have indulged in sentiments of
bitter hostility towards his enemies. When any of
them were guilty of tergiversations, either in their
public conduct or political friendships, he never
fails in his correspondence to mark their perfidy
and inconsistencies, and seems to enjoy with delight
their apostasy and disgrace. But after a certain
time he became less inimical to their persons, though
to the end of his life he never ceased to blame their
persecution of his father, which, indeed, many of
them subsequently <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'acknowleged to have'">acknowledged to have</ins> been unmerited
and unjust.</p>

<p>At the time when these Memoirs commence, the
resentments he retained on his father’s account
were directed less against the enemies who had
openly opposed, than against the friends who had
secretly betrayed and deserted him. He appears,
for instance, to have been reconciled very speedily
to Lord Granville, and ultimately to have become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
warm admirer of Mr. Pitt. But against the Pelhams
and Lord Hardwicke, whom he repeatedly and
unequivocally charges with treachery to his father,
his resentment was implacable.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In the early part
of his public life, his chief political friends appear
to have been Mr. Winnington and Mr. Fox. For
the former, who died in 1746, his admiration was
unbounded.</p>

<p>In his Memoirs, indeed, where in no instance but
one he ever confers praise unmixed with censure,
he bestows on Mr. Winnington the character of
being one “whom it was impossible to hate or to
trust;” and, in a subsequent passage, he describes
him “as perniciously witty, affecting an honesty in
avowing whatever was dishonourable.” But, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
his private correspondence, written immediately
after the sudden and melancholy death of Mr.
Winnington,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> he calls him one of the first men in
England, and adds, “I was familiarly acquainted
with him, loved and admired him, for he had great
good-nature, and a quickness of wit most peculiar
to himself; and for his public talents he has left
nobody equal to him, as before nobody was superior
to him but my father.”</p>

<p>With Mr. Fox he appears to have lived on the
most confidential terms, till that gentleman accepted
the Seals in 1755 under the Duke of Newcastle.
Mr. Walpole, whose inveteracy to the
Pelhams was unabated, could not pardon in his
father’s friend, a connexion with the man whom he
regarded as the chief traitor in the accomplishment
of his father’s ruin. The step too was taken
without consulting him. This added to his indignation;
and from that time, though he continued
in habits of intimacy with Mr. Fox, he became
cold to his interests, and, by his own account, was,
on one important occasion, active and successful
in traversing his designs.</p>

<p>He was, in truth, during the whole of his public
life, too much under the guidance of personal feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
and resentments, and too apt to sacrifice his
friendships to his aversions; and as the latter were
often excited by trivial and accidental causes, his
political conduct, though unexceptionable on the
score of interest or ambition, was fluctuating and
uncertain, and his judgment of men variable and
capricious. The affair of Admiral Byng, in which
he took a part that does credit to his feelings and
humanity, completed his estrangement from Mr.
Fox. He animadverts with great severity on the
cruelty of obstructing an irregular application for
mercy with the view of embarrassing an Administration.
The questionable conduct of Mr. Fox on
that occasion seems to have deserved some such censure;
but Mr. Walpole betrays his own partiality
by the comparative tenderness with which he treats
the Ministers themselves. They had it in their
power to save Admiral Byng, and justice as well as
humanity required them to exert it if they thought
him either injured or innocent. Yet they chose to
sign the warrant for his execution rather than
incur the odium with the King or the public of
insisting on his pardon.</p>

<p>About the time of his separation from Mr. Fox,
Mr. Walpole appears to have lost the influence he
had acquired over the Duke of Bedford through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
the intervention of Mr. Rigby; and during the
latter part of these Memoirs, detached from all
political intimacies, he seems to have had no better
means of information than might have been possessed
by any other industrious and attentive member
of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>On the merits of the present work it would be
improper to enlarge in this place. That it contains
much curious and original information will
not be disputed. The intimacy which the Author
enjoyed with many of the chief personages of the
times, and what he calls, “his propensity to faction,”
made him acquainted with the most secret
intrigues and negotiations of parties; and where
his resentments did not cloud his judgment,
his indifference to the common objects of ambition
rendered him an impartial spectator of their quarrels
and accommodations. The period of which he
treats was not distinguished by splendid virtues or
great vices, by extraordinary events or great revolutions;
but it is a part of our history little known
to us, and not undeserving our curiosity, as it
forms the transition from the expiring struggles of
Jacobitism to the more important contests that
have since engaged, and still occupy our attention.</p>

<p>The account of Parliamentary Debates in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
Memoirs would alone be a valuable addition to our
history. No one is ignorant, that from the fall of
Sir Robert Walpole to the American war, our
reports of the proceedings in Parliament are more
barren and unsatisfactory than at any period since
the reign of James the First. For the last ten
years of George the Second, Mr. Walpole has supplied
that deficiency in a manner equally entertaining
and instructive. His method was to make notes
of each speaker’s argument during the Debate, and
frequently to take down his expressions. He afterwards
wrote out the speeches at greater length,
and described the impression they made on the
House. The anecdotes interspersed in the work
are numerous, and, from the veracity of the Author,
when they are founded on his personal knowledge,
they may always be received as authentic.
When derived from others, or from the common
rumour of the day, he gives his authority for them,
and enables his readers to judge of the credibility
they deserve.</p>

<p>To his portraits it will be objected, that in
general they incline to severity, and though he
professed, and probably intended the strictest impartiality
in his delineations of character, it cannot
be denied that they are sometimes heightened by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
friendship, and more frequently discoloured by
resentment; and on many occasions it is evident,
that they are dictated by the conduct of the persons
he describes in the last occurrence that brought
them before his eyes, rather than by a steady and
comprehensive view of their merits and defects.
His observations on the Cavendishes may be taken
as an illustration of this remark. He seldom mentions
the two Dukes of Devonshire, who flourished
in his time, without some sneer or malignant reflection.
The truth was, that notwithstanding his
Whiggism, he held all the members of that family
in detestation, on account of the part they had
taken against him on his breach with his uncle
Lord Walpole. Yet, within a few years after the
conclusion of these Memoirs, when William, fourth
Duke of Devonshire, had bequeathed five thousand
pounds to his friend Mr. Conway, in approbation
of his public conduct, he uses the following exaggerated
expressions in speaking of the legacy.</p>

<p>“You might despise,” he writes to Mr. Conway,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
“the acquisition of five thousand pounds simply;
but when that sum is a public testimonial to your
virtue, and bequeathed <em>by a man so virtuous</em>, it is
worth a million. Who says virtue is not rewarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
in this world? It is rewarded by virtue, and persecuted
by the bad: can greater honour be paid to
it?”</p>

<p>There are, indeed, few persons in his Memoirs,
of whom he does not vary his opinion in the course
of his work. Marshal Conway, the Pelhams, and
Lord Hardwicke, are almost the only exceptions.
He always speaks of Marshal Conway with affection
and respect; of Mr. Pelham with dislike; of Lord
Hardwicke with hatred; and of the Duke of Newcastle
with contempt and aversion. Of other persons
mentioned in his book, there is scarcely any
strong expression of commendation or censure,
which in some subsequent passage he does not
qualify, soften, or contradict. It is a proof, however,
of his fairness, at least of his desire to give
his readers the impression he formed at the time of
the personages and transactions he describes, that
even when he changed his opinion, he allowed his
original account to remain, leaving it to be effaced
in the minds of others, as it was not unfrequently
in his own, by subsequent reflections and events.
In some instances, but rarely, he subjoins a note
correcting his first impression: more frequently he
only intimates to his readers his change of sentiment
by the difference of his language with respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
to the person he had before described. In his Memoirs
of 1752, for example, he characterizes Lord
George Sackville as a man “of distinguished
bravery,” and that passage he has left as originally
written, though after the battle of Minden he appears
to have had more than doubts of Lord
George’s courage. He was, in truth, as he says of
himself, a bitter, but placable enemy, a warm, but
(one instance only excepted) an inconstant friend.</p>

<p>It remains only to say a few words of the labours
of the Editor. He has added some notes marked
(E), and in some very few instances added or
altered a word for the sake of delicacy or perspicuity.
On such occasions the word added, or
substituted, is printed between brackets of this
shape [ ].</p>

<p>The spelling of the manuscript is peculiar, and
different from that in ordinary use. It was the
intention of the editor to have followed this orthography
in the printed book, knowing it was the
result of system and affectation, and not of accident
or carelessness. He has accordingly retained it in
the title of the book, and in words of unfrequent
recurrence; but, finding such vicious and affected
orthography disfigured the text, and fearing it
might perplex on perusal, he determined in common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
words to revert to the usual and approved mode of
spelling. The word <em>to-morrow</em>, for instance, which
Lord Orford always writes <em>to-morow</em>, he has
printed in the usual manner.</p>

<p>With respect to omissions, it is right to inform
the reader, that one gross, indelicate, and ill-authenticated
story had been cut out by Lord Waldegrave
before the manuscript was delivered to the
Editor; but he is assured the Author himself acknowledged
that the facts related in it rested on no
authority but mere rumour. Some, though very
few, coarse expressions, have been suppressed by
the Editor, and the vacant spaces filled up by
asterisks; and two or three passages, affecting the
private characters of private persons, and nowise
connected with any political event, or illustrative
of any great public character, have been omitted.
Sarcasms on mere bodily infirmity, in which the
Author was too apt to indulge, have in some instances
been expunged; and where private amours
were mentioned in the notes or appendix, the name
of the lady has been seldom printed at length,
unless the story was already known, or intimately
connected with some event of importance, to the
elucidation of which it was indispensable. Such
liberties would be still more necessary if the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
historical works of Lord Orford were ever
to see the light. They have been very sparingly
used on the present occasion, and appeared to be
warranted by the consideration, that, though the
work had been obviously written for publication,
it was left without directions how to dispose of it,
and entirely at the discretion of those by whose
authority it is now given to the public. Greater
freedom might perhaps have been taken, without
prejudice to the Author, or to his Memoirs. But
the Editor was unwilling to omit any fact or anecdote,
that had a direct or indirect tendency to
illustrate the causes, or trace the progress of any
political change or public event. The few omissions
made are entirely of a private nature, and, in
general, regard persons comparatively insignificant.</p>

<p>The Author had himself affixed an Appendix to
the work. Some of his notes, which were of an
inconvenient length, have been transferred to that
part of the book, and some articles have been added
by the Editor. The latter are marked with asterisks,
and are for the most part taken from notes
and compilations of Lord Orford himself, or of
some contemporary pen.</p>

with Lord Carteret, during Sir Robert Walpole’s
Administration, is told by Lord Orford in his Common Place
Book. When Lord Hervey was to be made Privy Seal (in
1740), the Duke of Newcastle, to prevent the appointment,
obtained Lord Carteret’s consent to accept the office, and
moved at Council, that it should be offered to him. Sir
Robert said he did not know whether Lord Carteret (who
was then in Opposition) would take the place. The Duke
said he would answer for him. Sir Robert replied, “I always
suspected you had been dabbling there, now I know it; but
if you make such bargains, I don’t think myself obliged to
keep them.” Lord Hervey had the office.</p></div>

<span class="fs80">TO THESE MEMOIRS.</span></h2>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>The reader has now seen these Memoirs; and
though some who know mankind, and the various
follies, faults and virtues, that are blended in our
imperfect natures, may smile with me at this free
relation of what I have seen and known, yet I am
aware that more will be offended at the liberty I
have taken in painting men as they are; and that
many, from private connexions of party and family,
will dislike meeting such unflattered portraits of
their heroes or their relations. Yet this, I fear,
must always be the case in any history written impartially
by an eye witness: and eye witnesses
have been generally allowed the properest historians.
Indeed, the editor of Chalon’s History of France
was of a different opinion, and lamented that Thuanus,
who has obliged the world with so complete
and so ample a history of his own times, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
have <em>confined</em> himself to write nothing but what
passed in his own time, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme sous ses propres
yeux</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Thus much I shall premise: if I had intended a
romance, I would not have chosen real personages
for the actors in it; few men can sit for patterns of
perfect virtue. If I had intended a satire, I would
not have amassed so many facts, which, if not
true, would only tend to discredit the Author, not
those he may censure. Yet councils and transactions,
not persons, are what I anywhere mean<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> to
blame. The celebrated Bayle has indeed offered a
notable excuse for all who may offend on the severer
side. “The perfection of a history,” says he,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> “is,
when it displeases all sects and all nations, this
being a proof that the author neither flatters nor
spares any of them, and tells the truth to all parties.”
A latitude this, in which I am not at all
desirous of being comprehended; nor very reconcileable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>with a notion of history which he has laid
down in another place.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> There he says, “As the
sacred history was not the work of a particular person,
but of a set of men, who had received from
God a special commission to write; in like manner,
civil history ought to be drawn up by none but
persons appointed by the State for that purpose.”</p>

<p>Unless State writers could be inspired, too, I fear
history would become the most useless of all studies.
One knows pretty well what sort of directions, what
sort of information would be given from a Secretary’s
office; how much veracity would be found,
even if the highest in the historical commission
were a Bishop Sprat. It is not easy to conceive
how Bayle, who thought it his duty to collect and
publish every scandalous anecdote from the most
obsolete libels, should at last have prescribed a
method of writing history, which reduces it to the
very essence of a gazette; a kind of authorized
composition which the most partial bigots to a
Court have piqued themselves upon exposing.
Roger North, the voluminous squabbler in defence
of the most unjustifiable excesses of Charles the
Second’s Administration, has drawn<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>picture of State Historians. “It was hard to
varnish over the unaccountable advancement of
this noble Lord without aid of the Gazetteer&mdash;but
the historian has made sure of a lofty character of
his Lordship, by taking it from the Court. We
may observe in his book in most years a catalogue
of preferments, with dates and remarks, which
latter, by the secretarian touches, show out of what
shop he had them; and certainly the most unfit for
history of any, because they are for the most part
not intended for truth but flourish; and what have
Court compliments to do with history?” Here I
beg leave to rest this part of my apology; and proceed
to answer other objections, which I foresee
will be made to me.</p>

<p>For the facts, such as were not public, I received
chiefly from my father and Mr. Fox, both men of
veracity; and some from communication with the
Duke of Bedford at the very time they were in
agitation. I am content to rest their authenticity
on the sincerity of such men; at the same time I
beg it may be remembered, that I never assert anything
positively unless from very good authority;
and it may be observed, that where I am not certain,
I always say, <em>it was said, it was believed, it was
supposed</em>, or use some such phrase. The speeches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
I can affirm, nay, of every one of them, to be still
more authentic, as I took notes at the time, and
have delivered the arguments just as I heard them;
never conceiving how it can be proper in a real
history to compose orations, as very probably counsels
were not taken in consequence of those arguments
which the Author supplies; and by that
means his reasoning is not only fictitious, but misleads
the reader. I do not pretend by this to assert,
that parliamentary determinations are taken in
consequence of any arguments the Parliament hears;
I only pretend to deliver the arguments that were
thought proper to be given, and thought proper to
be taken.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be thought that some of the characters
are drawn in too unfavourable a light. It has
been the mode to make this objection to an honest
Author, Bishop Burnet, though he only did what
Tacitus, the Cardinal de Retz, and other most approved
historians taught him to do, that is, speak
the truth. If I have thought such authorities sufficient,
I have at least acted with this farther caution,
that I have endeavoured to illustrate, as far as
I could, my assertions by facts, and given instances
of effects naturally flowing from the qualities I
ascribe to my actors. If, after all, many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
characters are bad, let it be remembered, that the
scenes I describe passed in the highest life, <em>the soil
the Vices like</em>:<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and whoever expects to read a
detail of such revolutions as these brought about by
heroes and philosophers, would expect&mdash;what? why,
transactions that never would have happened if the
actors had been virtuous.</p>

<p>But to appease such scrupulous readers&mdash;here are
no assassins, no poisoners, no Neros, Borgias, Catilines,
Richards of York! Here are the foibles of an
age, no very bad one; treacherous Ministers, mock
Patriots, complaisant Parliaments, fallible Princes.
So far from being desirous of writing up to the
severe dignity of Roman historians, I am glad I have
an opportunity of saying no worse&mdash;yet if I had, I
should have used it.</p>

<p>Another objection which I foresee will be made
to me, is, that I may have prejudices on my father’s
account. I can answer this honestly in a word: all
who know me, know, that I had no such prejudice
to him himself, as blinded me to his failings, which
I have faithfully mentioned in my character of him.
If more is necessary, let me add, his friends are
spared no more than his enemies; and all the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
I know of the latter I have faithfully told. Still
more; have I concealed my father’s own failings?
I can extend this defence still farther. Some of my
nearest friends are often mentioned in these Memoirs,
and their failings I think as little concealed as those
of any other persons. Some whom I have little
reason to love, are the fairest characters in the book.
Indeed, if I can call myself to any account for
heightening characters, it is on the favourable side;
I was so apprehensive of being thought partial,
that I was almost willing to invent a Lord Falkland.</p>

<p>With more reason I can avow myself guilty of the
last objection, I apprehend, and that is, having inserted
too many trifling circumstances. Yet, as this
is but the annal of a single year, events which
would die away to nothing in a large body of history,
are here material; and what was a stronger reason
with me, the least important tend to illustrate either
the character of the persons or the times. The objection
will particularly have weight against the
notes; I do not doubt but some anecdotes in them
will be thought very trifling; it is plain, I thought
them so myself, by not inserting them in the body
of the work. I have nothing to say for them, but
that they are trifles relating to considerable people;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
and such all curious persons have ever loved to read.
Are not such trifles valued, if relating to any reign
of 150 years ago? If this book should live so long,
these too may become acceptable; if it does not, they
will want no excuse. If I might, without being
thought to censure so inimitable an author, I would
remark that Voltaire, who in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Siècle de Louis
XIV</cite>. prescribes the drawing only the great outlines
of history, is as circumstantial as any chronicler,
when he feels himself among facts and seasons
that passed under his own knowledge.</p>

<p>If it is any satisfaction to my readers to assist
them in censuring the Author, I may say that I have
spared the most inconsiderable person in the book as
little as the demigods: obliquely it is true, for my
own character could have very little to do directly
in this Work: but I have censured very freely some
measures, for which I voted, particularly the transactions
about Mr. Murray, which I must confess were
carried on with an intemperate rashness very ill-becoming
Parliament or justice. Among these measures
I must not have involved the rigorous clauses
in the Mutiny Bill, or the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">præmunire</i> clause in
the Regency Bill, for none of which, I thank God,
I ever voted!</p>

<p>When I said I foresaw no other objections, let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
be understood to mean objections to faults that I
might have avoided, such as want of sincerity, partiality,
&amp;c.: I hope I have cleared myself from them.
As to the composition, I fear faults enough will
appear in it: I would excuse them too if I could:
but if imputations must lie upon my memory, let my
character as a writer be the scape-goat to bear my
offences!</p>

<p>It had been much expected that on the King’s return
from Hanover several changes would be made in
the Ministry. The Duke of Newcastle had, for some
time before his attending the King thither, disagreed
with the other Secretary of State, the Duke of Bedford,
not only because he had brought the latter into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the Ministry (his incessant motive of jealousy,) nor
from the impetuosity of the Duke of Bedford’s temper,
but from the intimate connexions that Lord Sandwich
had contracted with the Duke.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Lord Sandwich
had been hoisted to the head of the Admiralty by the
weight of the Duke of Bedford, into whose affection
he had worked himself by intrigues, cricket-matches,
and acting plays, and whom he had almost persuaded
to resign the Seals in his favour. There had been a
time when he had almost obtained the Duke of Newcastle’s
concurrence; and if he could have balanced
himself between the Duke and the Duke of Newcastle,
one may, without wronging the delicacy of his political
character, suspect that he would have dropped the
Duke of Bedford’s confidence. But a blind devotion
to the Duke’s inclinations, which he studied in all the
negotiations<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of the war and the peace, protracting
the one to flatter his command, and hurrying on the
other when no part of Flanders was left for the Duke’s
army, and himself was impatient to come over to advance
his interest in the Cabinet, this had embroiled
him with the Duke of Newcastle, and consequently
cemented his old attachments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Pelham had, according to his manner, tried to
soothe where his brother provoked, been convinced by
trifles that his brother’s jealousy was solidly grounded,
adopted his resentments, and promoted them. While
the Court was at Hanover, Lord Sandwich had drawn
a great concourse of the young men of fashion to
Huntingdon races, and then carried them to Woburn
to cricket-matches made there for the entertainment of
the Duke. These <em>dangerous</em> practices opened Mr.
Pelham’s eyes; and a love affair between one of his
[relations] and a younger brother<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of the Duchess of
Bedford fixed his aversion to that family. At this
period the Duke of Richmond<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> died, who besides the
Duchess and his own dignity, loved the Duke of Newcastle&mdash;the
only man who ever did. The Pelhams
immediately offered the Mastership of the Horse to
the Duke of Bedford, which he would have accepted,
had they left him the nomination of Lord Sandwich
for his successor.</p>

<p>The King came over: but though the brothers were
resolved to disagree with their associates in the Ministry,
they could not resolve to remove them; none
of the great offices were filled up but the Lieutenancy
of Ireland, from which Lord Harrington<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> was removed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>in the most unworthy manner. He had raised himself
from a younger brother’s fortune to the first posts in
the Government, without either the talent of speaking
in Parliament, or any interest there. He had steered
through all the difficulties of the Court and changes
of Ministry, with great dexterity, till, in the year 1746,
notwithstanding all his personal obligations to the
King, he was the first man who broke into his closet
at the head of those insulting and disloyal resignations
that were calculated and set on foot by the Pelhams,
in the very heat of the rebellion, to force their master,
by a general desertion of his servants, to abandon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Lord Granville, whom he was recalling into the
Ministry. The King had brooded over this ingratitude,
not with much hope of revenging it, but as he sometimes
resented such indignities enough to mention
them, the Pelhams sacrificed Lord Harrington to their
master, astonished at their complaisance, in order to
bargain for other victims on his part, which they would
have forced, not purchased, if there had been any
price necessary but their own ingratitude. Lord Harrington
was removed, and the Lieutenancy of Ireland
again heaped on the Duke of Dorset, then President
of the Council.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>January 10.&mdash;The South Sea Company having consented
to receive the hundred thousand pounds on the
new treaty with Spain in lieu of all their demands,
thought they had a title to some favour with the King,
and accordingly came to a resolution to address him,
to be pleased to continue their Governor, and to take
into his consideration the state of the Company. To
this message they received an answer in general terms.
They addressed again for one more particular: they
were told in very harsh phrase, that the King had obtained
for them from the Crown of Spain all that was
possible to be obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the conclusion of the Spanish war; fomented
(to overturn Sir Robert Walpole) by Lord
Granville, who had neglected it for a French war;
by Lord Sandwich, who made a peace that stipulated
for no one of the conditions for which it was undertaken;
by Pitt, who ridiculed and condemned his
own orations for it, and who declared for a peace on
any terms; and by the Duke of Newcastle, who
betrayed all the claims of the merchants and the
South Sea Company, when he had got power, to get
more power by sacrificing them to the interests of
Germany and the Electorate. As there never was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
a greater bloom of virtue and patriotism than at that
period, if posterity should again see as fair a show,
it will be taught to expect as little fruit.</p>

<p>17th.&mdash;The Parliament met. The King acquainted
the Houses with the new treaties concluded with
Spain for terminating our differences, and with Bavaria
for securing the peace of the Empire (by the
meditated election of the Archduke Joseph for King
of the Romans, was understood). The Address was
moved in the House of Lords by the Earl of Northumberland<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and the Lord Archer; and in the
Commons by Horace Walpole<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> (son of the late Earl
of Orford) and Mr. Probyn. Lord Egmont opposed
the Address, on the approbation it gave to the treaties,
and the subsidies it promised to pay, and proposed
leaving out many of the paragraphs. The
House sat till near eight; the speakers against the
Address were Mr. Henley, Mr. Bathurst, Sir John
Cotton, Mr. Vyner, Mr. Martin, Mr. Doddington,
Mr. Potter, and Dr. Lee; for it, Mr. W. Pitt, Mr.
Pelham, Sir J. Barnard, General Oglethorpe, Horace
Walpole senior, and Mr. Fox. Mr. William Pitt recanted
his having seconded the famous question for the
<em>no search</em> in the last Parliament; said it was a mad
and foolish motion, and that he was since grown ten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>years older and wiser: made a great panegyric on the
Duke of Newcastle’s German Negotiations of this
summer, and said he was himself so far from wishing
to lessen the House of Commons, that whatever little
existence he had in this country, it was owing to the
House of Commons. These recantations of his former
conduct were almost all he had left to make. On
his first promotion he had declared against secret
committees, and offered profuse incense to the manes
and friends of Sir Robert Walpole. He now exploded
his own conduct in contributing to kindle
the Spanish war, and hymned that Hanoverian adulation
in the Duke of Newcastle, which he had so
stigmatized in Lord Granville. Indeed, the Duke
of Newcastle had no sooner conquered his apprehensions
of crossing the sea, than he adopted all Lord
Granville’s intrepidity in negotiation. The Address
was carried by 203 to 74.</p>

<p>The morning the Parliament met, great numbers
of treasonable papers were dispersed by the Penny
Post, and by being dropped into the areas of houses,
called “Constitutional Queries,”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> levelled chiefly at the
Duke, whom they compared to Richard III. As it
was the great measure of the Prince’s Opposition to
attack his brother, the Jacobites bore but half the
suspicion of being authors of this libel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 22nd the Duke of Marlborough<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> moved in
the House of Lords to have the Queries burnt by the
hangman, which was agreed to, and they communicated
their resolution to the Commons at a conference
in the Painted Chamber. Sir John Strange, Master
of the Rolls, in a lamentable discussion, seconded by
the Attorney-General, Rider, moved to concur with
the Lords. Sir Francis Dashwood, after much disclaiming
of Jacobitism, objected to the word <em>false</em> in
the resolution, as he thought some of the charges
in the Queries not ungrounded, particularly in the
complaint against alarm-posts, and the dismission of
old officers, an instance of which he quoted in the
person of his uncle, the Earl of Westmoreland, who
had been removed seventeen years before, and under
the administration of Sir Robert Walpole. General
Handasyde, a blundering commander on the Prince’s
side, spoke strongly against the Queries; and Colonel
Richard Lyttelton, with a greater command of absurdity,
spoke to the same points as Sir Francis
Dashwood; like him, disclaimed Jacobitism, and wished
that “even a worse punishment than burning could
be found out for the paper;” told a long story of
Colonel George Townshend’s having been refused
leave to stay in Norfolk, “though he was cultivating
the Whig interest;” and an alarming history of the
Duke’s having placed two Sentinels to guard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
ruins of Haddock’s Bagnio and the Rummer Tavern
at Charing-cross, which had been burnt down;
and then ran into a detail of the abuse on the
King about the Hanover troops in the year 1744,
when his own relations and friends had been at the
head of the Opposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham answered in a very fine speech, and
said, he had a new reason for condemning this paper,
as he saw it already had had part of its intended
effects, in catching honest minds. Lord Egmont
made an extremely fine and artful speech, “That in
general he disliked such methods of proceeding against
libels, for two reasons; that he did not approve of
Parliament taking the business of the law upon them,
and because such notice only tended to spread the
libel more; but that the present was of so evil a
nature, that no censure could be too severe, especially
as it was calculated to sow division between two
brothers of the Blood Royal, where he was persuaded
and hoped there was no such thing: that if there
were any grounds for the accusations in the paper, he
should choose a more proper day to inquire into them,
and would; that as to the case of the Hanover
troops,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> he did not know why, as the same Ministry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
continued, <em>that</em> satire was left so unpunished, this so
condemned; or why the author of this was so sought
after, the authors of the other so promoted.” The
resolution was agreed to, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemine contradicente</i>, and
an Address presented to the King, to desire him to
take effectual means to discover the author, printers,
and publishers of the Queries, which were burnt on
the 22nd.</p>

<p>The same day, Lord Barrington<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> moved that the
number of seamen should be but eight thousand for
the present year. Nugent, Lord Egmont, Potter,
and the Opposition, declared for the old number of
ten thousand, on a supposition that the view of the
Ministry was to erect the land army into our principal
force. W. Pitt, who, with his faction, was
renewing his connexions with the Prince of Wales,
as it was afterwards discovered, and impatient to be
Secretary of State, which he expected to carry, as
he had his other preferments, by storm; and the
competition between him and Fox, the principal
favourite of the Duke, breaking out more and more,
said (without previously acquainting Mr. Pelham
with his intention) that if the motion had been made
for ten thousand, he should have preferred the greater
number. Potter immediately moved for them, and
Pitt agreed with him. Mr. Pelham seemed to acquiesce;
but when the question was put, Lord Hartington,
a favourite by descent of the old Whigs, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
show Pitt that he would not be followed by them if
he deserted Mr. Pelham, divided the House, and the
eight thousand were voted by 167 to 107; only Pitt,
Lyttelton, the three Grenvilles, Colonel Conway, and
eight more, going over to the minority.</p>

<p>On the 28th, Mr. Cooke, a pompous Jacobite, and
Member for Middlesex, presented a long petition from
several of the Electors of Westminster against Lord
Trentham. This election and scrutiny had taken up
above five months of the last year. The resentment
of the Jacobites against Lord Gower for deserting
their principles had appeared in the strongest colours,
on the necessity of his son being rechosen, after being
nominated into the Admiralty. They had fomented
a strong spirit against Lord Trentham, on his declining
to present a petition to the King in favour of a
young fellow<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> hanged for a riot; and on his countenancing
a troop of French players<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> in the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>theatre in the Haymarket. Lord Egmont, who was
intriguing to recover his interest in Westminster, had
set up a puppet, one Sir George Vandeput; and the
Pelhams were suspected of not discouraging the
opposition. On Lord Trentham’s success, a petition
had been framed in such treasonable terms, that Mr.
Cooke himself waved undertaking it, and this new
one was drawn up: Sir John Cotton opposed the
party’s petitioning at all, but did not prevail. Both
Mr. Cooke and the petition severely abused the High
Bailiff (whose practice, as a lawyer, the Jacobites
totally destroyed), and who, as Mr. Cooke said, had
attempted to violate the maiden and uncorrupted city
of Westminster.</p>

<p>Lord Trentham,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> who had never spoken in Parliament
before, replied with great manliness and
sense, and spirit, reflecting on the rancour shown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
him and his family, and asserting that the opposition
to him had been supported by perjury and by subscriptions,
so much condemned and discountenanced by
the Opposition, when raised to maintain the King on
the Throne during the last Rebellion. In answer to
the censure on the High Bailiff, he produced and read
a letter from Mr. Cooke to the High Bailiff, while he
was believed in their interest, couched in the strongest
terms of approbation of his conduct and integrity.
This was received with a loud and continued shout.
It was long before Mr. Cooke could get an opportunity
of replying, and longer before he had anything
to reply. He reflected on Lord Trentham’s not
telling him of this letter, and justified it. Lord
Egmont talked of his own obligations to Westminster,
called Mr. Cooke’s letter honest flattery, to encourage
a man to do his duty; and said that the opposition to
Lord Trentham was the sense of the nation, expressed
against the Administration.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox replied with great wit and abilities, and
proved that of all men in England Lord Egmont had
least obligation to Westminster, which had rejected
him at the last general election, and exposed the doctrine
of honest flattery, which was only given, when
the person it was given to was thought honest, by
acting as his flatterer desired. Mr. Fox was apt to
take occasion of attacking Lord Egmont, the champion
against the Duke, and because, after Mr. Fox had
managed and carried through his contested election,
Lord Egmont had not given one vote with the Court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Mr. Cooke moved to hear the petition that day fortnight;
Lord Trentham for the morrow se’nnight,
which was agreed to. Lord Duplin then moved to
call in the High Bailiff to give the House an account
how he had executed the orders which he received last
February of expediting the scrutiny as much as possible.
He came, pleaded many obstructions, and being
asked why he had not complained, said, he had feared
being taxed with putting an end to the scrutiny.</p>

<p>Lord Trentham then desired he might be asked, if
he remembered any threats used to him. Lord Egmont
objected to the question, and the High Bailiff
was ordered to withdraw. A long debate ensued,
though Mr. Fox proposed to put the question in these
less definite words, “how he had been obstructed.”
At last it was proposed that the Speaker should decide,
whether, supposing the High Bailiff accused any
person, they could be heard to their defence, consistently
with the orders of the House, before hearing the
merits of the petition. The oracle was dumb&mdash;at last
being pressed, it said, “I wish, without using many
words, I could persuade gentlemen to go upon some
other matter.” Lord Trentham finding the Speaker
against him, and the Ministry and one or two of the
old Whigs inclined to give it up, gave it up with
grace and propriety. But the young Whigs, headed
by Lord Coke, grew very riotous, and though the
Speaker declared still more fully against them, they
divided the House, and carried it by 204 to 106 to
call in the High Bailiff, who, returning to the bar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
charged Crowle, Sir George Vandeput’s Counsel, with
triumphing in having protracted the scrutiny, and
with calling the orders of the House <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">brutum fulmen</i>.
Being further questioned, he said he had been scandalously
abused; had received papers threatening his
life; had been charged with running away to Holland;
had been pursued into the vestry after declaring
the majority for Lord Trentham; had been stoned
there, and that one gentleman at the head of the mob
had asked them, if nobody had courage enough to
knock the dog down, and that he ought to be killed.
Being asked who this was, he named Mr. Alexander
Murray, brother of Lord Elibank; both such active
Jacobites, that if the Pretender had succeeded, they
could have produced many witnesses to testify their
zeal for him; both so cautious, that no witnesses of
actual treason could be produced by the Government
against them: the very sort of Jacobitism that has
kept the cause alive, and kept it from succeeding.
Mr. Murray, with Crowle and one Gibson, an upholsterer,
were ordered to attend on the Thursday following
with the High Bailiff, to have his charge made
out.</p>

<p>29th.&mdash;The report for the eight thousand seamen
was made from the committee, and debated again till
past eight at night, when it was agreed to by 189 to
106. Mr. W. Pitt spoke with great affectation of
concern for differing with Mr. Pelham, protested he
had not known it was his measure (which Mr. Pelham
made many signs of not allowing), and that it was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
fear of Jacobitism which had made him differ on this
only point with those with whom he was determined
to lead his life. He called the fleet our standing army,
the army a little body of military spirit, so improved
by discipline, that that discipline alone was
worth five thousand men; made great panegyrics on
Mr. Pelham (so did Lyttleton and George Grenville),
and concluded with saying, “I do not believe the
majority of this House like eight thousand better
than ten.”</p>

<p>The times were changed! Men who remembered
how Sir Robert Walpole’s fears of the Pretender and
his Spithead expeditions were ridiculed by his opponents,
admired Mr. Pitt’s humility and conviction, who
was erecting a new opposition on those arguments.</p>

<p>He was attacked by Hampden, who had every attribute
of a buffoon but cowardice, and none of the
qualifications of his renowned ancestor but courage.
He drew a burlesque picture of Pitt and Lyttleton
under the titles of <em>Oratory</em> and <em>Solemnity</em>, and
painted in the most comic colours what mischiefs
rhetoric had brought upon the nation, and what emoluments
to Pitt. Pitt flamed into a rage, and nodded
menaces of highest import to Hampden, who retorted
them, undaunted, with a droll voice that was naturally
hoarse and inarticulate. Mr. Pelham interposed, and,
according to his custom, defended Pitt, who had deserted
him; gave up Hampden, who had supported
him. It was not unusual for Pitt to mix the hero
with the orator; he had once blended those characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
very successfully, when, having been engaged to make
up a quarrel between his friend Hume Campbell<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and
Lord Home, in which the former had kissed the rod,
Pitt within very few days treated the House with
bullying the Scotch declaimer. On the present occasion,
the Speaker insisted on the two champions
promising to proceed no farther, with which Punch
first, and then Alexander the Great, complied.</p>

<p>31st.&mdash;Mr. Crowle appeared with the High Bailiff
at the bar of the House, and owned the words charged
on him, but endeavoured to prove that the protraction
was meant for the benefit of his client; and that
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">brutum fulmen</i> was applied to those who urged
him with the orders of the House impertinently. He
showed great deference and submission to the House.
It was then debated till six o’clock, whether any witnesses
should be called in against him, and carried by
204 to 138, that there should. Three were called,
who proved the words. Lord Hartington, (whose
head being filled with the important behaviour of
the Cavendishes and Russels at the Revolution, was
determined that it should be the fault of the times,
not his, if his conduct did not always figure equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
with theirs in solemnity), moved, with a pomp of
tragic tenderness, and was seconded by Lord Coke,
who abused the independent electors, “that Mr. Crowle
had wilfully protracted the scrutiny, and showed contempt
of the House.”</p>

<p>This was opposed;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> the lawyers pleaded <em>in
earnest</em> for their brother, and the Ministry were
inclined to give it up, till Lord Egmont made a
furious speech for Crowle, and called the Whigs the
Rump of their old party. Mr. Fox took this up
warmly in an exceedingly fine speech of spirit and
ridicule, and concluded with telling Lord Egmont,
that though he intended to have interceded for Crowle
(who had interest at Windsor, where Fox was chosen),
he must now be for this resolution; but yet should
show compassion for Mr. Crowle, if it were only on
his having such a friend. The House divided at
eleven at night, and the resolution passed by 181 to
129. Lord Hartington then offered to the House to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
take Mr. Crowle into custody, or to reprimand him
immediately; the latter of which was chosen for him
by Mr. Fox, and he was reprimanded on his knees by
the Speaker. As he rose from the ground,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> he
wiped his knees, and said, “it was the dirtiest house
he had ever been in.”</p>

<p>The Whigs took pleasure in copying the precedents,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
that had been set them at the famous Westminster
Election, in 1742; and the Speaker had the
satisfaction both times of executing the vengeance of
either party, and indulging his own dignity. On
the former occasion, his speech to the kneeling Justices
was so long and severe, that the morning it was
printed, Sir Charles Hanbury Williams complained to
him of the printer’s having made a grievous mistake&mdash;“Where?&mdash;how?
I examined the proof sheet
myself!” Sir Charles replied, “in the conclusion he
makes you say, <em>more</em> might have been said; to be sure
you wrote it, <em>less</em> might have been said.”</p>

<p>The King on these votes commended the young
men, and said to the Duke of Newcastle before the Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>of Bedford, “they are not like those puppies who are
always changing their minds. Those are your Pitts
and your Grenvilles, whom you have cried up to me
so much! You know I never liked them.”</p>

<p>February 1.&mdash;Mr. Murray appeared at the bar of
the House of Commons, and heard the High Bailiff’s
charge. He asserted his innocence; said he should
deny nothing that was true; that much was false;
smiled when he was taxed of having called Lord
Trentham and the High Bailiff rascals, and desired
Counsel, which, after a debate of two hours, was
granted to him, and a respite till the Wednesday following,
upon condition of his being taken into custody,
and giving bail for his appearance. Gibson, the
upholsterer, was then brought to the bar, witnesses
for and against him heard, and the words proved,
though some members<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of the House, who had been
present at the conclusion of the scrutiny, did not hear
him speak them. Sir William Yonge moved a resolution
of his guilt, which was carried by 214 to 63,
and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'he committed to'">he was committed to</ins> Newgate.</p>

<p>Sir William Yonge<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> was still employed in any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>government causes where the Ministry wanted to inflict
punishments and avoid odium&mdash;their method of acquiring
merit! His vivacity and parts, whatever the
cause was, made him shine, and he was always content
with the lustre that accompanied fame, without
thinking of what was reflected from rewarded fame&mdash;a
convenient ambition to Ministers, who had few such
disinterested combatants! Sir Robert Walpole always
said of him, “that nothing but Yonge’s character<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
could keep down his parts, and nothing but his parts
support his character.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Yesterday morning (Dec. 8, 1756), died at his house in
the Stable-yard, St. James’s, the Right Hon. William Stanhope,
Earl of Harrington, a General of his Majesty’s Forces, a
Governor of the Charter-house, a Fellow of the Royal Society,
and one of the Lords of his Majesty’s Most Honourable Privy
Council.
</p>
<p>
His Lordship served in the reign of Queen Anne in Spain,
being Captain of a Company, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel,
in the third regiment of Guards; and in the end of the year
1710 was constituted Colonel of a regiment of Foot.
</p>
<p>
On the accession of his late Majesty he was appointed Colonel
of a regiment of Dragoons, and returned to Parliament for the
town of Derby; and in 1715 was made Colonel of a regiment of
Horse. On the 19th of August, 1717, he was appointed Envoy
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the King of Spain.
</p>
<p>
November 17, 1718, he was appointed Envoy and Plenipotentiary
to the Court of Turin; from whence he returned to
Paris; and, May 31, 1719, set out for the Duke of Berwick’s
camp before Fontarabia. After Admiral Byng had destroyed
the greatest part of the Spanish fleet, Colonel Stanhope procured
an English squadron to fall upon the port of St. Anthony
in the Bay of Biscay, in which were one Spanish man-of-war
of seventy guns, and two of sixty, newly built, with an incredible
quantity of timber, pitch, and tar, and other naval stores,
for building more; all which were destroyed by the English
squadron, assisted by a detachment which the Duke of Berwick
spared from his army, at the solicitation of Colonel Stanhope,
who contrived the design, and, serving as a volunteer in the
enterprise, principally contributed to the execution of it; where,
finding it necessary to encourage and animate troops which had
not been used to enterprises by sea, he was the first that leaped
into the water when the boats approached the shore.
</p>
<p>
At the end of that war he was declared a Brigadier-General,
and returned with the same character as before to Spain. But
the Spaniards having laid siege to Gibraltar, he left Madrid on
the 11th of March, 1726, and his late Majesty was pleased, in
May, 1727, following, to appoint him Vice-Chamberlain of his
Household, and to command him to be sworn of his Privy
Council.
</p>
<p>
After his present Majesty’s accession, he was nominated first
Ambassador and Plenipotentiary to the Congress at Soissons;
and September 9, 1729, declared Ambassador to the King of
Spain. On the 20th of November following, he was advanced
to the degree of a Peer of Great Britain, by the title of Lord
Harrington; and on the 13th of June, 1730, was constituted
principal Secretary of State. December 18, 1735, he was
declared Major-General of the Horse; and Lieutenant-General,
July 17, 1739. His Lordship resigned the Seals, February 12,
1741-2, and the next day was declared Lord President of the
Council. February 9, 1741-2, he was raised to the dignity of a
Viscount and Earl of Great Britain, by the title of Viscount
Petersham, Earl of Harrington.
</p>
<p>
On the resignation of Earl Granville, October 18, 1744, his
Lordship was again appointed principal Secretary of State; <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'and and in 1745'">and
in 1745</ins> attended on his Majesty to Hanover. February 10,
1745-6, his Lordship resigned the Seals; but his Majesty was
pleased to re-deliver them to him four days after.
</p>
<p>
November 22, 1746, his Lordship was declared Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland, in the room of the Earl of Chesterfield, in which
post he continued until 1771. March 22, 1746-7, he was constituted
General of his Majesty’s Foot forces.
</p>
<p>
His Lordship’s rare accomplishments were such, that it is difficult
with justice to determine whether he deserved most our
admiration for his political integrity in the Cabinet, or for his
military conduct in the field; whether he excelled most as a perfectly
fine gentleman, or as a man of letters. But, without
flattery, he deserved to have it said of him&mdash;

<p class="verse">So mix’d in him, that Nature might stand up,</p>
<p class="verse">And say to all the world, “This was a man!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
His Lordship married Anne, daughter and heir of Colonel
Edward Griffith, one of the Clerks Comptrollers of the Green
Cloth, by Elizabeth his wife, daughter of Dr. Thomas Laurence,
first Physician to Queen Anne; and by her had two sons, twins,
born December 18, 1719; but their mother died in child-bed.
Thomas, the younger, was in August, 1741, appointed Captain
in Honeywood’s Dragoons, and going over sea, died February,
1742-3.

French Players had been brought over, but the audience and
populace would not suffer them to perform. Another company
came over in 1750, but with no better success. Several young
men of quality had drawn their swords in the riot, endeavouring
to support them: Lord Trentham’s being present had been
exaggerated into his being their chief protector. French
Players had been no uncommon spectacle in England. The
foundation of the late animosity against them was this. The
opposition to the Court had proceeded so far, as to be on the
point of ridiculing the King publicly on the stage of the little
theatre in the Haymarket, in a dramatic satire, called the
“Golden Rump,” written by Fielding. Sir R. Walpole, having
intelligence of this design, got the piece into his hands&mdash;[I have
in my possession the imperfect copy of this piece, as I found it
among my father’s papers after his death]&mdash;and then procured
the act to be passed for regulating the stage, by which all
theatres were suppressed but such as should be licensed by the
Lord Chamberlain. This provoked the people so much, that
the French company having a licence granted soon after, when
several English companies were cashiered, it was made a party
point to silence foreign performers.</p></div>

Bart., LL.D., F.R.S., Knight of the Most Honourable Order of
the Bath, one of his Majesty’s Most Honourable Privy Council,
and Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of Carnarvonshire.
He was chosen to represent the borough of Honiton in the sixth
Parliament of Great Britain, which was summoned to meet on
the 10th of May, 1722, and served for that borough in the five
succeeding Parliaments; for though chosen for Ashburton in the
eighth, and Tiverton in the seventh and tenth, he each time
made his election for Honiton, and was five times re-elected on
his accepting places. In the present Parliament he represented
Tiverton. He was appointed to be one of the Lords of the
Treasury in March, 1724; a Lord of the Admiralty in May,
1728; again a Lord of the Treasury in May, 1730; Secretary
at War in May, 1735; and in May, 1746, joint Vice-Treasurer
of Ireland. He is succeeded in his estates and title of Baronet
by his only son, now Sir George Yonge, member for Honiton.&mdash;[From

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> He was vain, extravagant, and trifling: simple out of the
House, and too ready at assertions in it. His eloquence, which
was astonishing, was the more extraordinary, as it seemed to
come upon him by inspiration, for he could scarce talk common
sense in private on political subjects, on which in public he
would be the most animated speaker. Sir Robert Walpole has
often, when he did not care to enter early into the debate himself,
given Yonge his notes, as the latter has come late into the
House, from which he could speak admirably and fluently,
though he had missed all the preceding discussion. He had
been kept down for some time by the prevailing interest of
General Churchill with Sir Robert Walpole, on the following
occasion. Yonge, in a poetic epistle (to which he had great
proneness, though scanty talents) addressed to Hedges, who was
supposed to be well with Mrs. Oldfield, said, speaking of that
actress in the character of Cleopatra,

</div></div>

<p>
[The dead and living Cleopatra.]&mdash;This coming to the fair one’s
knowledge, she never ceased, till she had made such a rupture
between her fond General and Yonge, as had like to have ended
in the total ruin of the latter.</p></div></div>

<p>February 4th.&mdash;An army of 18,850 men was proposed.
Lord Limerick<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> moved for 15,000. Ever since
the defeat of Lord Bath, he had been listed under the
Prince, but for the last three or four years had lived
retired in Ireland. He had preserved a sort of character
from the impossibility of his being dismissed
with the rest of his friends, as he had secured the reversion
of a large sinecure for life, and, consequently,
had less occasion to be intriguing after new preferment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
His speeches were reckoned severe, and it was not his
fault if they did not answer the character; he meant
to wound, but his genius did not carry equal edge
with his temper. Martin, a West Indian lawyer,
attached to the Prince, made a speech of great wit
against standing armies, with very new arguments.
The eighteen thousand men were voted in the committee
by 240 to 117, and carried next day on the
report, after a long debate, by 175 to 75.</p>

<p>6th.&mdash;The High Bailiff produced eight witnesses
against Mr. Murray, who gave the strongest evidence
of his menaces and seditious behaviour. He was then
heard by his Counsel, who brought the High Constable,
Carne, Mr. Gascoyne, Lord Carpenter, and Sir John
Tyrrel, to invalidate the charge. The first only
proved that the words might have been said without
his hearing them; the second confirmed the accuser’s
charge in some particulars. Lord Carpenter, with
the greatest decency, gave the most unconscientious
evidence; but though he confined it to negatives, he
at last contradicted himself, and was materially contradicted
by Sir John Tyrrel, a foolish young Knight,
who did not know how to reconcile his awe of the
House with the little regard he had for what he was
ready to depose. Lord Carpenter was undertaking
Westminster, and having lately succeeded to a large
estate, seemed to think elections the most equal way
of restoring the sums which his father had amassed
by excessive usury. The Counsel made small defence;
one of them even made an excuse for engaging in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
cause. Mr. Murray then advanced to the bar, and
said he was ashamed of nothing he was accused of
having said, but calling Lord Trentham a rogue to
the chimney-sweeper, which was below him to have
done.</p>

<p>The High Bailiff made short, clear, and fair observations
on the evidence. Colonel Richard Lyttleton
then moved a long resolution of the proofs being full,
and was seconded by Colonel George Townshend. Sir
Francis Dashwood opposed it, and would have reduced
all the proofs to immaterial words, and the probability
of one of the witnesses having mistaken the sound of
a voice when he did not see the face of the person who
spoke them, though he turned immediately and saw
Mr. Murray, whose voice he had recollected. Lord
Duplin replied. Sir John Cotton reflected on the
length of the motion brought ready drawn, and complained
of the House not having paid due regard to
his evidence for Gibson; and both he and Sir Francis
laid great stress on the dignity and character of Lord
Carpenter. Mr. Fox answered in one of the finest,
most spirited, and artful speeches that he ever made;
set Lord Duplin’s evidence against Cotton’s; summed
up the whole charge and proofs, and instead of ridiculing
Sir John Tyrrel’s ridiculous evidence, as less
able speakers would have done, he enforced it, commented
it, and then produced it against Lord Carpenter’s.
Lord Egmont made an artful speech, W.
Pitt a florid one, T. Pitt a dull one.</p>

<p>During the debate, the strangers in the gallery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
were called to, to withdraw; the Speaker said that
was his business, unless any gentleman would move it,
and then he would be obliged to him. Lord Coke
rose, moved it, and said, “Sir, I am that gentleman,
and grant your request.” The Speaker immediately
ordered them to withdraw, and said with a smile,
“and, my Lord, I have obeyed your commands.”
But as soon as they were gone, he fell into a pompous
passion, and complained of Lord Coke’s repeating his
words; having mistaken a disposition to pomp in
another for burlesque, which he did not perceive was
the result of the thing, and not of the intention. The
episode concluded with Lord Coke’s begging his pardon,
and with his being content to have thought himself
affronted, as at all events it had procured him
submission.</p>

<p>Of the Prince’s people only thirteen stayed to vote;
and towards midnight, the resolution was carried by
210 to 74. It was then moved to send Mr. Murray
close prisoner to Newgate. Sir John Cotton and
others divided on the word <em>close</em>, but were only 52 to
169: Lord Egmont and his faction had retired. The
young Whigs, angry at this second division, determined
to bring Murray on his knees; and it was proposed
to Mr. Pelham in the lobby: he consented, and
it was moved by Colonel Lyttleton and Lord Coke.
The Tories were enraged, and divided again, after
Mr. Dowdeswell had moved for the Tower; but a precedent
having been quoted of Middleton, the Sheriff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of Denbigh, being sent to Newgate (in times<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> that
the Whigs loved now to imitate, from the aversion
they had felt to the first example), while they were
disputing on the word <em>close</em>, and Mr. Harding had made
the Clerk read the journal till it came to the resolution
of addressing the King even to take away an office
from Middleton, Mr. Fox recurred to that precedent,
and said, “If the gentlemen of North Wales, where the
Middletons of Chirk Castle are one of the most ancient
families, would yield the precedence to the Murrays,
he would consent that the latter should go to the
Tower.”</p>

<p>It being carried by 163 to 40, that he should be
brought on his knees, he was called in. He entered
with an air of confidence, composed of something between
a martyr and a coxcomb. The Speaker called
out, “Your obeisances! Sir, your obeisances!”&mdash;and
then&mdash;“Sir, you must kneel.” He replied, “Sir, I
beg to be excused; I never kneel but to God.” The
Speaker repeated the command with great warmth.
Murray answered, “Sir, I am sorry I cannot comply
with your request, I would in anything else.” The
Speaker cried, “Sir, I call upon you again to consider
of it.” Murray answered, “Sir, when I have committed
a crime, I kneel to God for pardon; but I know
my own innocence, and cannot kneel to any body
else.” The Speaker ordered the Serjeant to take him
away, and secure him. He was going to reply; the
Speaker would not suffer him. The Speaker then made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a representation to the House of his contemptuous
behaviour, and said, “However you may have differed
in the debate, I hope you will be unanimous in his
punishment! Pray consider on it; if he may with
impunity behave thus, there is an end of the dignity
and power of this House!”</p>

<p>Sir George Oxenden said he had foreseen this
refusal, and had not voted for bringing him on his
knees, and was not answerable for the consequences&mdash;a
fine consolation in their dilemma! Mr. Harding
quoted three precedents where persons, and some of
them members, had received their sentence on their
knees. Mr. Pelham proposed a committee to search
for precedents how to treat him, and that they should
give their opinion upon it. Mr. Cooke went out, and
tried to persuade him to submit; but he said he
would sooner cut his throat. Mr. Fox went so far
as to mention a place of confinement in the Tower,
called Little Ease; but Mr. Pelham declared against
such severe corporal punishment. Sir William Yonge
proposed the closest confinement in Newgate without
being visited, (a triumph which the Tories meditated
for him,) and without pen, ink, and paper. This
opinion was afterwards taken up by Lord George
Sackville, and agreed to, though Vyner urged that
he would be punished twice if they adhered to the
former sentence after his submission. Alderman
Jansen moved in vain to adjourn. W. Pitt hinted
at a bill to be passed against him if he would not
comply. Admiral Vernon made such an outrageous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
speech against these proceedings, desiring to have
Magna Charta referred to the committee, that he was
several times taken to order by the Speaker, Sir John
Mordaunt, and Mr. Pelham, and was on the brink of
falling under the sentence of the House. The Speaker
himself proposed the question on Murray’s contempt,
which Sir John Cotton tried to prevent being inserted
in the votes, but it passed, with the order for his
closer confinement; and then, after naming the committee,
the House, at near two o’clock in the morning,
adjourned over the next day.</p>

<p>At five in the morning, Mr. Murray was carried
in a hackney-coach strictly guarded to Newgate. He
sung ballads all the way; but on entering the gaol
burst into tears, kissed the Serjeant, said he was very
ill, and must have a physician. In two days the
House was mollified, permitted him to be ill, and
gave leave for his brother to visit him with a physician
and an apothecary; and in five days more, their
compassion grew so tender as to indulge him with the
company of his sister, a nurse, and his own servant.</p>

<p>11th.&mdash;The staff was opposed by Lord Egmont,
Dr. Lee, Nugent, Potter, and Bathurst; defended by
Mr. Fox, Mr. Pelham, Sir William Yonge, Lord
George Sackville, Lord Barrington, and General Mordaunt,
and carried by 205 to 88. In the night, new
Queries<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> abusing the House of Commons for their
proceedings on the Westminster affair were dispersed
at several doors, but no notice was taken of them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
The Commons were not eager to have more prisoners
to nurse!</p>

<p>12th.&mdash;Sir George Vandeput’s and the Westminster
petitions were withdrawn. Some of the independents
had tried to prevent it; and, at a meeting on the 9th,
thirty-seven divided for going on with them against
thirty-one: but Sir George declaring he would withdraw
his, and he, Lord Carpenter, and Sir Thomas
Clarges leaving the meeting, it was agreed to drop
both petitions.</p>

<p>13th.&mdash;Sir William Yonge acquainted the House,
that the committee of which he was chairman was
ready with their report on Mr. Murray’s case; but
as the prisoner was ill, they desired to postpone it to
the following Monday. Mr. Cooke presented a petition
from Gibson the upholsterer, who had not
caught the infection of heroism from his fellow
captive, but begged for enlargement, which was
granted, and he was ordered to attend on the morrow,
when he was reprimanded on his knees, and discharged.</p>

<p>The same day Mr. Pelham opened the Ways and
Means, in which he generally shined, and did not
disgrace his master, Sir Robert Walpole, though the
latter had gathered his chief laurels from his knowledge
and perspicuity in that service. Sir John Cotton
piddled with a little opposition to the land-tax of
three shillings, but it was carried by 106 to 43, and
on the report by 229 to 28. They could not conjure
up a spirited division now on the most popular points:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
if they were not new, they would scarce furnish a
debate.</p>

<p>Sir John Cotton had wit, and the faithful attendant
on wit, ill-nature, and was the greatest master
of the arts of the House, where he seldom made but
short speeches, having a stammering in his elocution,
which, however, he knew how to manage with
humour.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In the end of Queen Anne’s reign he was
in place;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> during Sir Robert Walpole’s administration
constantly and warmly in opposition, and was so
determined a Jacobite, that though on the late coalition
he accepted a place in the Household, and held
it two years, he never gave a vote with the Court,
which argued nice distinction, not only in taking the
oaths to the King (for that all the Jacobites in Parliament
do), but in taking his pay, and yet obstructing
his service: and as nice in the King’s Ministers,
who could discover the use of making a man accept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>a salary without changing his party. When the
Duke of Bedford, with all my Lord Russel’s integrity
of Whiggism, was involved in a Jacobite opposition,
he had been so suspicious, as to mistrust Sir John’s
principles, till my Lord Gower quieted his uneasiness
by assuring him, “Cotton is no more a Jacobite than
I am.”</p>

<p>18th.&mdash;Sir William Yonge read the report of the
committee appointed to search for precedents on Murray’s
case. It concluded with proposing to send for
him again to the bar of the House: but as gentler
counsels, and a candour that might have been equitable
before his contempt, though absurd now, prevailed,
Sir William only moved to have the report lie
on the table, saying, that if Murray should not submit
this session, he should move in the next to resume
the sentence. Mr. Pelham spoke much for moderate
proceedings&mdash;more moderate indeed it would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
been difficult to pursue after the lengths themselves
and Murray had gone; but they who wanted to extort
a submission from him for offences which he had
not acknowledged, were ready to release him after an
outrage which he gloried in, and had no ways atoned.
Mr. Fox read a paragraph from the Whitehall Evening
Post, by which it appeared that Murray had had
the use of pen, ink, and paper, and had been writing
an apology for some part of his private conduct;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> the
greatest part of which his future historian may be
glad to colour over with the varnish of martyrdom.
Mr. Fox, on this apparent recovery of the prisoner’s
nerves, moved to order the physician and apothecary
to attend that day se’nnight with an account of Mr.
Murray’s state of health, which was agreed to.</p>

<p>On the 19th, 20th, and 21st, the Mutiny Bill was
debated each day for several hours. This Bill, which
formerly had passed as quietly as the Malt Act, had,
for the two or three last years, constantly afforded the
longest contests. Lord Egmont<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> had gained his
greatest reputation by opposing it; and he was
not a man to forget, or to let any body else forget
where his strength lay. His great talent was indefatigable
application, which he loved rather than wanted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>for his parts were strong, and manly, and quick: his
heart rather wanted improvement than his head;
though when his ambition and lust of Parliament were
out of the question, he was humane, friendly, and as
good-humoured as it was possible for a man to be who
was never known to laugh; he was once indeed seen
to smile, and that was at chess. He did not dislike
mirth in others, but he seemed to adjourn his attention
till he could bring back the company to seriousness.
He was personally very brave, as brave as if
he were always in the right.</p>

<p>His father had trained him to history and antiquities;
and he early suckled his own political genius
with scribbling journals and pamphlets. Towards the
decline of Sir Robert Walpole’s power, he had created
himself a leader of the Independents, a contemptible
knot of desperate tradesmen,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> many of them converted
to Jacobitism by being detected and fined at the
Custom-house for contraband practices. By those
people he was shoved into Parliament on the expulsion
of Lord Sundon and Sir Charles Wager; but
having written that masterly pamphlet called “Faction
Detected,” in defence of Lord Bath’s political apostasy,
the patron and champion mutually lost their popularity,
and nothing was openly remembered of Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Percival’s works, but a ridiculous history<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> of his own
family, which he had collected and printed at an
immense expense. Thus exploded, he was very willing
to take sanctuary with his leader in the House of
Lords; but the Ministry did not think his sting formidable
enough to extract it by so dear an operation:
how often since has Mr. Pelham wished him laid up in
ermine!</p>

<p>At the beginning of this Parliament, rejected by
Westminster, and countenanced nowhere, he bought
the loss of an <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'election at Weobly'">election at Weobley</ins>, for which place,
however, on a petition, Mr. Fox procured him to be
returned by Parliament, and had immediately the
satisfaction of finding him declare against the Court,
declared a Lord of the Bedchamber to the Prince, and,
on the first occasion, the warmest antagonist of the
Duke and the Mutiny Bill. On Lord Trentham’s
being opposed at Westminster last year, Lord Egmont
tried, by every art and industry, to expiate his offences
in the eyes of his old electors, and was the great
engine of the contest there. All the morning he passed
at the hustings; then came to the House, where he was
a principal actor; and all the evening he passed at
hazard; not to mention the hours he spent in collecting
materials for his speeches, or in furnishing them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
his weekly mercenaries. With this variety of life, he
was as ignorant of the world as a child, and knew
nothing of mankind though he had acted every part
in it. But it is time to continue the history of the
Mutiny Bill, and to conclude with the conclusion
of his Lordship’s memoirs of his family and himself&mdash;“let
us here leave this young nobleman struggling
for the dying liberties of his country!”</p>

<p>When the Duke had set himself to restore the discipline
of the army, and bring it nearer to the standard
of German severity, he found it necessary to reform
the military code, that whatever despotism he had a
mind to establish might be grounded in an appearance
of law. The Secretary at War, with a few
General Officers, was ordered to revise the Mutiny
Bill, and (if one may judge by their execution of this
commission) to double the rigour of it. The penalty
of death came over as often as the curses in the Commination
on Ash-Wednesday. Oaths of secrecy were
imposed on Courts Martial; and even officers on half-pay
were for the future to be subject to all the jurisdiction
of military law. My Lord Anson, who governed
at the Admiralty Board, was struck with so amiable a
pattern, and would have chained down his tars to a
like oar; but it raised such a ferment in that boisterous
profession, that the Ministry were forced to drop
several of the strongest articles, to quiet the tempest
that this innovation had caused.</p>

<p>The Mutiny Bill was likely to pass with less noise;
when Colonel Richard Lyttleton, intending mischief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
though without seeing half way into the storm he was
raising, took notice of the extraordinary novelties and
severity of these modern regulations. He was a
younger brother of the pious George Lyttelton, with
less appearance of, but with not much more real
integrity. He was grown a favourite of the Prince
of Wales by a forwardness of flattery that had revolted
even the Duke, at whose expense on some disobligations
he was now paying court to the elder brother.</p>

<p>He was seconded by Colonel George Townshend,
eldest son of my Lord Townshend, a very particular
young man, who, with much oddness, some humour,
no knowledge, great fickleness, greater want of judgment,
and with still more disposition to ridicule, had
once or twice promised to make a good speaker. He
was governed by his mother, the famous Lady Townshend,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
who having been neglected by the Duke, after
some overtures of civility to him, had dipped into all
the excess of Scotch Jacobitism, and employed all her
wit and malice, the latter of which, without any
derogation to the former, had vastly the ascendant,
to propagate the Duke’s unpopularity. The Pelhams,
who were very near as ill with her, had placed their
nephew, Mr. Townshend, in the Duke’s family, to
remove him from her influence; and the Duke had
softened his haughtiness as much as possible to second
their views. But my Lady Townshend’s resentments
were not at all disappointed by this notable scheme,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
nor by the opportunities it gave her son of learning
more of his commander’s temper, nor by the credit it
gave to any reflections on him when authorized by, or
coming directly from one of his own servants and a
supposed favourite. The Duke has often said since,
that he was never hurt but by the ingratitude<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> of Mr.
Townshend and Lord Robert Sutton, whom he had
made the greatest efforts to oblige.</p>

<p>This attack from two officers was artfully relieved
by Lord Egmont, who had stickled so vehemently
against the innovations, that one after another they
were given up, or much softened one year after
another, though not till many disagreeable instances
had been publicly produced of his Royal Highness’s
arbitrary control, and though they had been defended
in a masterly manner by Mr. Fox, Lord George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Sackville, and Colonel Henry “Seymour” Conway;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
the latter a young officer, who having set out upon a
plan of fashionable<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> virtue, had provoked the King
and Duke by voting against the Army at the beginning
of the war. He was soon after, by the interest
of a near relation of his, placed in the Duke’s family,
where he grew a chief favourite, not only by a steady
defence of military measures on all occasions, but by
most distinguished bravery in the battles of Fontenoy
and Laffelt (in the latter of which he was taken
prisoner), by a very superior understanding, and by
being one of the most agreeable and solid speakers in
Parliament, to which the beauty of his person, and
the harmony of his voice, did remarkably contribute.</p>

<p>This year a new field was opened, during the discussion
of the Mutiny Bill, by Sir Henry Erskine,
another young officer, lately brought into Parliament
by the Duke of Argyle. This man, with a face as
sanguine as the disposition of the Commander-in-Chief,
had a gentle plausibility in his manner, that
was not entirely surprising in a Scotchman, and an
inclination to poetry, which he had cultivated with
little success either in his odes, or from the patrons to
whom they were dedicated; one had been addressed
to the Duke, and another to an old gentlewoman at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>Hanover, mother of my Lady Yarmouth. Of late he
had turned his talent to rhetoric, and studied public
speaking under the baker at the Oratorical Club<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> in
Essex-street, from whence he brought so fluent, so
theatrical, so specious, so declamatory a style and
manner, as might have transported an age and audience
not accustomed to the real eloquence and graces
of Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>It was on the second debate on the Mutiny Bill
this year, that Sir Harry Erskine, complaining of the
exorbitant power of General Officers on Courts
Martial, instanced in his own case, and severely
abused General Anstruther, who had treated him
very rigorously some years before at Minorca. The
charge was so strong, that Mr. Nugent said, if the
General (who was not present) did not appear next
day and justify himself, he would move for an inquiry
into his conduct. This was so well received, that the
Secretary at War thought proper to write to General
Anstruther to acquaint him with the accusation. He
appeared the next day, and spoke some time, but with
so low a voice, and so strong a Scotch accent, that
scarce ten people heard or understood him. He said
“he had undergone a long persecution from his
countrymen, who all hated him for having been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
only Scot that, on Porteous’s affair, had voted for
demolishing the Nether Bow at Edinburgh.” He
produced and read an anonymous and bitter letter
wrote against him to the late Duke of Argyle, with two
letters to himself, one from the author to own the
former, and to beg his pardon for it; the other from
the council of war at Minorca to vindicate him to
the General. He said he suspected Sir Harry Erskine
of having been in the conspiracy against him, which
he had not punished near so rigorously as it deserved:
and he concluded with justifying his government,
where, he affirmed, he had eased the people of all
taxes imposed by former Governors.</p>

<p>Sir Harry Erskine, with all the false lustre of oratory,
and all the falsehood of an orator, replied in an
affected gesture of supplication; besought the House
to proceed no further in this affair; said he had forgiven
all the ill-usage, had mentioned nothing out of
revenge, and now pardoned the General’s suspicions.
This justification ill-heard, and this deprecation as
ill-founded, concluded the affair for the present as
awkwardly as it had been begun. The General’s
charge against his countrymen was undoubtedly well-grounded,
and that of tyranny against him, no less.
Indeed, the Scotch would have overlooked his tyranny
to the Minorchese, if they could have forgot his supporting
the Government, when it was necessary to
chastise the mutinous disposition of Scotland, where
Captain Porteous had been murdered insolently and
illegally by the mob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Anstruther had been tried before the Council for
his unwarrantable behaviour in his government a few
years ago, and a heavy number of articles proved
against him; but Lord Granville defeated the charge
by calling in a Minorchese, and talking to him for an
hour in Spanish, and then assuring the Council that
the witness had fully justified the General. The secret
of Erskine’s being willing to drop his accusation was
on receiving intimation that Anstruther, if pushed,
would recriminate on General St. Clair, Sir Henry’s
uncle, who, on the expedition to Port L’Orient, had
used the most violent methods to bring a Court Martial
over to his opinion, and had abused Lord John
Murray, the President of it, in the grossest terms,
who, on this occasion, begged Mr. Fox to tell the
King and Duke from him, that his only reason for
having taken no steps to complain of that usage, was
for fear of increasing the heats already raised on the
Mutiny Bill; but that at a proper time he would seek
some redress.</p>

<p>A committee had been appointed to consider on
amending the laws enacted against the vices of the
lower people, which were increased to a degree of
robbery and murder beyond example. Fielding, a
favourite author of the age, had published an admirable
treatise on the laws in question, and agreed
with what was observed on this occasion, that these
outrages proceeded from gin. The depopulation of
the city was ascribed to the same cause, which gave
Nugent occasion very properly to offer again his Bill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of general Naturalization, a favourite Whig point,
overthrown in the Queen’s time by the narrow ignorance
of the Tories, and defeated in the first session
of this Parliament by Mr. Pelham’s complaisance for
Sir John Barnard. It was now received, and the
second reading ordered for the 20th, the day before
which a petition was presented against it from the
city of London. The next day they presented another
against gin, on which old Horace Walpole attacked
Sir John Barnard on the absurdity of their remonstrating
on the decrease of people, and their making
interest against replacing them by foreigners. Nugent
ridiculed him on the same topic, and made a distinction
of humour between the good citizen in his fur
gown and corporate capacity, and really wishing well
in his mercantile capacity to trade and populousness:
and he observed, that even in this enlightened age,
the city of London had not got beyond the prejudices
of the reign of Harry the Third, the laws of that
age against aliens, and the reasoning of the present
petition against naturalizing foreigners being exactly
the same.</p>

<p>Sir John Barnard was as little ready to reply to
banter, as Nugent was inferior to him in reasoning.
The citizen, with the most acute head for figures,
made that sort of speaking still more unpleasant by
the paltriness of his language, as the arrogance of his
honesty clouded the merit of it. The Irishman’s style
was floridly bombast; his impudence as great as if he
had been honest. Sir John’s moroseness looked like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
ill-nature, and may be was so. Nugent affected unbounded
good-humour, and it was unbounded but by
much secret malice, which sometimes broke out in
boisterous railing, oftener vented itself in still-born
satires. Sir John Barnard had been attached to Lord
Granville, but had been flattered from him by Mr.
Pelham. Nugent’s attachments were to Lord Granville;
but all his flattery addressed to Mr. Pelham,
whom he mimicked in candour, as he often resembled
Lord Granville in ranting. Sir John Barnard meant
honestly, and preserved his disinterestedness: he
would probably have sunk in his character of a great
genius, if he had come into business with Sandys and
others&mdash;as they did. Nugent<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> <span class="nowrap">* * * *</span>
had lost the reputation of a great poet, by writing
works of his own, after he had acquired fame by an
ode<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> that was the joint production<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> of several others.
One would have thought his speeches had as different
an origin; sometimes nothing finer, generally nothing
more crowded with absurdities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time all was faction, and splitting into
little factions. The Pelhams were ill with one another,
and ill with the Bedfords. The latter Duke would
have set up Fox against Mr. Pelham; and the former
Duke<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> was countenancing Pitt against all. Mr. Pelham
supported Pitt and his clan against the Duke of
Cumberland, who was united with the Bedfords. The
Prince’s Court, composed of the refuse of every party,
was divided into twenty small ones. Lord Egmont
at the head of one, Nugent of another, consisting of
himself and two more, Lady Middlesex and Doddington
of a third, the chief ornament of which was the
Earl of Bute, a Scotchman, who, having no estate,
had passed his youth in studying mathematics and
mechanics in his own little island, then simples in the
hedges about Twickenham, and at five and thirty had
fallen in love with his own figure, which he produced
at masquerades in becoming dresses, and in plays
which he acted in private companies with a set of his
own relations. He became a personal favourite of
the Prince, and was so lucky just now as to give up a
pension to be one of the Lords of his Bedchamber.
The Jacobites had quarrelled at Oxford on the choice
of a member, and would not join with the Prince, who
courted them. Lord Granville, Lord Chesterfield,
and Lord Winchelsea, were each separately courted by
the Duke of Newcastle, and Lord Oxford by Mr.
Pelham, who at the same time was making new connexions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
trying to preserve the old ones, adopting his
brother’s jealousies, and yet threatening to resign on
account of them. He had once solemnly declared in
the House of Commons, that he would retire from
business as soon as the rebellion should be extinguished.
When the Duke of Grafton was told of
this vow, he said, “God, I hope my friend will see
the rebellion twinkle a good while yet in the Highlands!”</p>

<p>22d.&mdash;Sir Hugh Dalrymple moved for Mr. Golding
(apothecary to the Prince of Wales) to have leave to
attend Murray, being used to bleed him, which, as his
veins laid low, was difficult for any other person to do.
Mr. Pelham observed on the impropriety of this, as
the doctor and apothecary were to appear on Monday.
Mr. Fox said, he had heard that they would report
he was very well, and proposed that the House should
name a surgeon. It was at last agreed that Golding
should go to bleed him, but should not be called for
any account of his health.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham, in the committee, opened the subsidy
of forty thousand pounds a year to be paid to Bavaria
for six years, twenty by England, and ten each by the
Empress-queen and Holland. Martin made a speech
of great wit against it, Lyttleton a learned one, and
Murray, Solicitor-General, a very masterly one for it.
It was obvious that the latter, not Mr. Pelham, had
been instructed in the true secret of this negotiation
by his friend Stone, secretary to the Duke of Newcastle.
They had been bred at Christ Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
together, and had tasted of the politics of Oxford
as well as of its erudition. Sir Robert Walpole, on
quitting the Ministry, had cautioned Mr. Pelham
against Stone, having touched upon the scent of some
of his intrigues, as he was hunting after Jacobite
cabals. Mr. Pelham neglected the advice, as he had
before rejected the offer of having Sir Robert’s clue of
secret intelligence put into his hands. He would
scarce have found either Stone’s or Murray’s name
there from this time; they were converted by their
own interest,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> a conviction preferable to all detection.
Lord Egmont spoke ill, and owned it was rather a
right than a wrong measure; and was answered by
Pitt in a good but too general a speech. Between
seven and eight the House divided, but the majority
for the subsidy appearing very great, it was given up
without telling. This treaty with some others was
calculated to purchase a majority of votes to choose
the Archduke King of the Romans, but France and
Prussia defeated the scheme: our Ministry could not
buy off their opposition, as they bought off opponents
at home, and they knew no other art of baffling an
enemy.</p>

<p>25th.&mdash;The Bavarian Subsidy was debated on the
report, and carried by 194 to 77. Then Dr. Lamont
was called in and asked several questions about Murray’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
health. He said he had found him with a cold
and a fever, of which he was so well recovered this
day se’nnight, that he had since visited him only
every other day; but that going to Newgate on
Saturday, he had found him with the cramp in his
stomach, to which he had been subject these seven
years, and of which his sister expected he would have
died the day before: that he thought close confinement,
without riding, dangerous for him: that he had
advised him to petition the House for his liberty,
though he had heard nobody else give him the same
advice; but that Mr. Murray had replied in a passion,
“he would take his prescriptions, but not his
counsel.” Sir William Yonge then moved to restrain
everybody but the Physician, Apothecary, and Nurse
from visiting him, which being opposed, particularly
by Lord Egmont, who reflected on the want of precedents,
the Speaker made a warm and solemn speech
for the honour of the House, instanced in the Earl of
Shaftesbury and others, who had knelt to receive the
reprimand of the House of Lords, and said that the
want of a precedent of such behaviour as Murray’s
did but conclude more strongly against him. Sydenham,
a mad High-Church zealot, taking notice of some
epithets the Speaker had used on Murray, was interrupted
by him, saying, “I called him high-spirited
too; if he had been only wrong-headed, I should
have forgiven him.” The restriction was voted by
166 to 81.</p>

<p>The same day, Lord Chesterfield brought a Bill into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the House of Lords for reforming our Style according
to the Gregorean account, which had not yet been
admitted in England, as if it were matter of heresy to
receive a Kalendar amended by a Pope. He was
seconded by Lord Macclesfield, a mathematical Lord,
in a speech soon after printed, and the Bill passed
easily through both Houses. Lord Chesterfield had
made no noise since he gave up the Seals in 1748,
when he published his Apology for that resignation.
It was supposed to be drawn up by Lord Marchmont,
under his direction, and was very well written; but
to my Lord Chesterfield’s great surprise, neither his
book nor his retirement produced the least consequence.
From that time he had lived at White’s,
gaming, and pronouncing witticisms among the boys
of quality.</p>

<p>He had early in his life announced his claim to wit,
and the women believed in it. He had besides given
himself out for a man of great intrigue, with as slender
pretensions; yet the women believed in that too&mdash;one
should have thought they had been more competent
judges of merit in that particular! It was not
his fault if he had not wit; nothing exceeded his efforts
in that point; and though they were far from producing
the wit, they at least amply yielded the applause he
aimed at. He was so accustomed to see people laugh
at the most trifling things he said, that he would be
disappointed at finding nobody smile before they knew
what he was going to say. His speeches were fine,
but as much laboured as his extempore sayings. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
writings were&mdash;everybody’s: that is, whatever came
out good was given to him, and he was too humble
ever to refuse the gift. But, besides the passive
enjoyment of all good productions in the present age,
he had another art of reputation, which was, either to
disapprove the greatest authors of other times, or to
patronize and commend whatever was too bad to be
ascribed to himself. He did his admirers the justice
to believe that they would applaud upon his authority
every simple book that was published, and every bad
actor that appeared upon the stage.</p>

<p>His first public character was Embassador to Holland,
where he courted the good opinion of that economical
people by losing immense sums at play. On
his return he attached himself to Lord Townshend,
who was then breaking with Sir Robert Walpole, and
did himself no good by that connexion: but what
pinned down his disgrace, was the Queen’s seeing him
one Twelfth Night, after winning a large sum of money
at hazard, cross St. James’s Court, to deposit it with
my Lady Suffolk till next morning:&mdash;the Queen never
pardoned an intimacy there. He continued in Opposition
for the remainder of Sir Robert Walpole’s
Ministry, and after the ineffectual motion in 1740 for
removing that Minister, Lord Chesterfield was dispatched
to Avignon by the party to solicit, by the
Duke of Ormond’s means, an order from the Pretender
to the Jacobites, to concur roundly in any measure for
Sir Robert’s destruction: they had retired without
voting on the question abovementioned. Lord Chesterfield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
had accepted no employment till the removal
of Lord Granville, when he was sent again to Holland,
and then made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and
became the most popular Governor they ever had.
Nothing was cried up but his integrity, though he
would have laughed at any man who really had
any confidence in his morality: and how little he
repented his negotiations at Avignon would appear, if
a story told of him is authentic (which I do not
vouch), that being at Dublin in the height of the
Rebellion, a zealous Bishop came to him one morning
before he was out of bed, and told him he had great
grounds to believe the Jacobites were going to rise.
The Lord Lieutenant coolly looked at his watch,
and replied, “I fancy they are, my Lord, for it is
nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>He had married the Duchess of Kendal’s niece,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
designing to become heir to her aunt, but had not the
address to succeed; yet, miscarrying with the late
King’s mistress, he was rewarded by old Marlborough
among the rest of the legatees,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> whom she had selected
for the prejudice they had done to the Royal Family.
She was scarce cold before he returned to the King’s
service. In short, my Lord Chesterfield’s being the
instrument to introduce this new era into our computation
of time will probably preserve his name in
almanacs and chronologies, when the wit that he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>but laboured too much, and the gallantry that he
could scarce ever execute, will be no more remembered.</p>

<p>26th, 27th.&mdash;The Mutiny Bill was finished. Sir
Henry Erskine declared he should postpone till next
year the offer of several more clauses and amendments.</p>

<p>28th.&mdash;The Naturalization Bill was read a second
time. Petitions for it had been presented from Bristol
and Liverpool; and this day Mr. Nugent presented
another from one hundred and forty-two very considerable
Merchants of London. Mr. Sydenham
desired to have the names read, that it might appear
many of them were Foreigners. Nugent observed,
that it was evident from thence that men of all denominations
were for it; and Sir William Yonge, that
Foreigners already composed a very serviceable and
considerable part of our Merchants. Sir John Barnard
spoke an hour and a half against the commitment,
and then stalked away to dinner, according to his
custom, without deigning to wait for any reply. To
every body’s surprise, Mr. Pelham declared for the
Bill, said he had always approved the principle of it,
but had formerly feared its raising disturbances; but
that finding no reason to apprehend that consequence
now, since our trading cities concurred in petitioning
for it; that we were daily in want of recruits for
Nova Scotia, and to repair our losses by the war; and
having last year received applications from Spitalfields
for encouragement of Foreign hands and materials,
and having actually encouraged the importation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of the latter, he hoped we should, and he
would now vote for encouraging the former. On
Mr. Pelham’s having formerly offended the Whigs by
opposing this scheme, the Duke of Bedford, trusting
to his adhering to the same style, had eagerly
taken up the protection of this Bill, and privately
made great interest to carry it through. Mr. Pelham
discovered this, and turned short, and carried it for
the commitment. The Duke of Bedford’s faction
being thus baffled, made a shorter turn, kept away,
and the Bill was lost at last. Mr. Fox, who had
formerly at Mr. Pelham’s desire spoken against the Bill,
stuck to his former vote, at the same time showing
that he approved the Bill, though he said he doubted
if it would have any effect. Pitt spoke immediately
after Fox for the Bill; and it was committed by a
majority of 146 to 81, three only of the Whigs
adhering with Mr. Fox to their former vote. The
House sat till past nine.</p>

<p>March 4.&mdash;George Townshend moved to have all
papers relating to Courts Martial during General
Anstruther’s government of Minorca laid before the
House, and complained of his still keeping his regiment,
though he had been found guilty by the Privy
Council. Sir Harry Erskine again disclaimed revenge,
but, with heaping new aggravations, said he
had still more in reserve to urge against him; defied
any retaliation on his uncle St. Clair, and affirmed
that partialities had lately been exercised towards the
Scotch&mdash;not favourable ones. Mr. Pelham replied
to this; said he knew little of military promotions,
but could observe from the Newspapers, that there
were at least as many Erskines and Dalrymples preferred
as of any English name; that he disliked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
proceeding parliamentarily in this business, but would
engage to have Anstruther tried by a Court Martial.
Mr. Pitt gave strongly into a Parliamentary Inquiry.
Mr. Fox was as warm against it, and said that if
Sir Harry Erskine had not openly disclaimed revenge,
he should have much suspected him of harbouring the
bitterest, especially as Sir Harry had too much parts
to have accused out of ignorance. He urged the
impropriety of trying a man after an Act of Grace
had passed, which that he did not mention from
prejudice would appear from his having voted at
Council for condemning Anstruther. The Attorney
and Solicitor Generals spoke to the same point of Law.
Fazakerely endeavoured to show that pardons from the
Crown were not pleadable against impeachments,
which were now threatened by Lord Egmont and
others. The Attorney in answer showed that the
Act of Grace was the act, not of the Crown singly, but
of the whole Legislature. Colonel Haldane, who had
been one of the warmest against Murray, talked high
for inquiries, more necessary, he now said, than prosecutions
on elections. Mr. Conway temporized,
proposed a middle way; the House was going to
divide, when Mr. Fox moved for some fewer papers
that would serve the purpose, and that Sir Harry
Erskine might have two days to prepare a charge in
form; but desired it might be delivered in before
the papers in question were brought, that they might
not be assisting to the composition. The House sat
till past nine without dividing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>5th.&mdash;George Townshend presented a vehement
petition from one Don Juan Compagni, a Minorchese,
who had been barbarously treated by Anstruther;
had had his sentences reversed by the Council here;
but having run in debt while he attended the event
of his suit, had applied without success to the Treasury
for money to carry on the prosecution: this was
the scope too of the petition, though Mr. Townshend
said it was only presented to be in the eye of the
House when the other trial should come on, and
moved to have it lie upon the table. Mr. Pelham
owned he had refused money from the Treasury, and
observed upon the impropriety of suffering such petitions,
as it would encourage the like from all our
Governments and Plantations: that for his part he
would not oppose it, unless somebody else did, and
then he should be for rejecting it. Lord Duplin and
Harding spoke against the want of order in it, as the
accused was a member, as the petition would appear
at length in the votes, a heavy accusation! and as
the money must be granted without hearing either
the cause or the defendant; or if heard, you might
find a crime, and could not find a punishment.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt spoke warmly for the petition, on the
fitness of granting two or three thousand pounds to a
poor man oppressed by military law, and of so good a
family as the Compagnis, (so deeply was Mr. Pitt
versed in Minorchese genealogies!) and declared he
would support such a cause to the last drop of his
blood. Mr. Fox ridiculed this warmth; observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
how little foundation there was for believing the allegations
of the petition, and then said he discovered
much persecution in this affair; that good men would
join in the persecution if they thought Anstruther
guilty; others would, because he had been guilty of
what he did not think bad (the vote on Porteous’s
case); and that it was Anstruther-guilt, as much as
the guilt of the Governor, that had blown up this
vengeance; and then he moved for rejecting the
petition, or for the Orders of the Day. Pitt disclaimed
warmth, but with so much coolness and
endeavours to be cool, that it only proved him more
angry. Colonel Haldane defended the Scotch; Oswald
still more, and called on Fox to charge them. Mr.
Fox said he scorned prudence when it was honesty to
speak out; urged the notoriety of the national inveteracy
to the General, to a degree, that a petition on
a contested election having been presented against
him soon after his vote of offence, all the Scotch members
had to a man voted against him; and said, that
as he himself had been warm on the affair of Porteous’s
murder, a Scotch General Officer had told
him at the time, “young man, this will never be
forgiven you.”</p>

<p>This pique created a constant opposition between
Fox and Oswald, a man who was master of a quickness
and strength of argument, not inferior to Fox,
or any speaker in the House. The rapidity of his
eloquence was astonishing; not adorned, but confined
to business. He had come into Parliament about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
time of Sir Robert Walpole’s fall, and had consulted a
friend, whether the Minister or the Opposition were
likely to prevail. His friend recommended him to the
former; his own sagacity conducted him to the latter,
which being soon after victorious, he reproached his
friend with the scrape into which he had near drawn
him. On the change he was made a Commissioner of
the Navy, which he resigned on the New Place Bill,
to keep his seat; but wavering in his connexions, had
no new preferment. Mr. Conway spoke for the
Orders of the Day; but asking if the intention was to
hear the cause, and Pitt telling him it was, he then
spoke and voted for the petition. Lord Egmont made
a very fine and inflammatory speech for it, and said the
nation would so much resent its being rejected, that
no man who voted for the rejection would dare to
show his face. Mr. Pelham took this up, said he
would serve the King and his line faithfully, in place
and out of place too, without opposing from resentment,
and then should always dare to show his face
any where. Pitt then endeavoured to prevent a division,
but was disregarded; and towards seven o’clock
it was carried by 97 to 58 for reading the Orders
of the Day. Lord Ankram, Carneguy, Hope Weir,
and M’Cleod, voting in the majority, and no English
Whigs but Pitt, Conway, and the three Grenvilles in the
minority. When the House was up, Pitt, in a dispute
with Mr. Pelham, defended parliamentary inquiries,
and said, “he would never consent to lop the
bough on which he stood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The King asked Mr. Fox “with whom it was that
Pitt meant to ingratiate himself? was it with Lord
Egmont?” and he told the Duke of Bedford that he
would not, even if addressed by the House, take away
Anstruther’s regiment, who had got his favour by the
vote that had so much offended his countrymen.
The General, after that vote, had been obliged on his
return to Scotland, to pass in disguise to his own
estate, and crossing a firth, he said to the waterman,
“This is a pretty boat; I fancy you sometimes
smuggle with it.” The fellow replied, “I never
smuggled a Brigadier before.”</p>

<p>Pitt’s behaviour, who at this time had the
chief influence with the Duke of Newcastle, had extremely
offended both the King and the Whigs. The
tide of popularity was running with the Duke of Bedford
and Mr. Fox; and without the great event<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> that
soon after happened, possibly the charm might have
been broken, that held a whole nation enchanted to
such phantoms, either of honesty or abilities as the
two Pelhams.</p>

<p>The 7th was appointed for the Naturalization Bill,
but the House adjourned to attend at Drury-lane,
where Othello was acted by a Mr. Delaval and his
family, who had hired the theatre on purpose. The
crowd of people of fashion was so great, that the Footman’s
Gallery was hung with blue ribbands.</p>

<p>8th.&mdash;The Bill was read in the Committee. Mr.
Fox spoke against it, but said he was open to conviction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Mr. Pelham mentioned the forfeited estates in
Scotland, which might be improved by a colony of
Foreigners. Mr. Fox declared himself convinced by
this argument. Pitt ridiculed Fox’s conviction, and
did it well. The Bill was carried in the Committee by
123 to 52. While Pitt was speaking, Fox said to
one who sat next to him, “He is a better speaker
than I am; but, thank God, I have more judgment!”</p>

<p>Lord Halifax had been soliciting to have a fifty
and a sixty gun ship sent to Nova-Scotia, upon a report
that the French were sending a fleet thither: the
Admiralty had refused, for fear of drawing on a new
war. The Board of Trade presented a long Memorial
to promote their demand, which the Duke of Bedford
carried to the King; the Duke of Newcastle was
present, but said not a word. The Duke of Bedford
said to the King, “Sir, this paper is too long for
your Majesty to read, but I will tell you the purport
of it: it is a project of the same faction, who have endeavoured
to increase the Navy this year: I have
desired your Majesty’s servants to meet at my House
next Wednesday; I believe they will not think it
proper to come into this proposal.” “No,” replied
the King, “they are the most troublesome, impracticable
fellows I ever met with; there is no carrying
on the measures of Government with them.” Mr.
Pelham wrote the Duke of Bedford word, on his summons,
that he would wait upon him, but did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
believe<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> he should think Lord Halifax’s proposal fit to
be complied with.</p>

<p>11th.&mdash;A proposal came from the South Sea Company
for lowering their interest after a term of seven
years. Mr. Pelham moved to accept it, provided
they gave up all demands on the King of Spain. Belchier
desired time till the next General Court; but the
resolution passed.</p>

<p>Lord Duplin<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>, who, considering how fond he was of
forms and trifles and being busy, was not absolutely a
bad speaker, opened in a long deduction the affairs of
Nova-Scotia, and moved for a sum of money for carrying
on that new Colony, the establishment of which
had been eagerly revived by Lord Halifax on his
coming to the head of the Board of Trade, and his
friend Colonel Cornwallis<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, sent thither as Governor,
who was a brave, sensible young man, and of great
temper and good-nature. Vyner alone opposed the
Motion; the Opposition favoured it, and Th. Pitt
spoke much against ever giving up that Colony to
France.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Erskine then presented his charge against
General Anstruther, which he called only a state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>his own case. It was very trifling in comparison of
what had been expected from the parade of his first
accusation; his grievances barely comprized in a confinement
of six weeks before and during his trial, and
of a few days after it. George Townshend moved to
address for the proceedings of that Court-Martial.
Mr. Pitt desired there might be no Motion till the
House came to some determination how to proceed.
Mr. Fox read a letter from Anstruther, to say that he
was laid up with the rheumatism, but would attend
as soon as possible, and would send in an answer to
the charge. It was agreed to send him a copy of what
they were in doubt whether to call a charge, or a complaint,
or simply a paper. Mr. Fox called upon
Erskine to prove the accusation, which he said he was
ready to do. Fox then said, that General Anstruther
desired to inform the House that he had the copy of
the Court-Martial in his own possession, and would
send it whenever they pleased; though it was not
necessary to preserve sentences of acquittals, nor were
they ever sent to the War-office. Notwithstanding
this voluntary offer, the House sat debating for two
hours on the method of coming at this copy, and
whether they should address the King, or order
Anstruther to send it by their own authority. Joddrell,
the Prince’s Solicitor, flamed, and Lord Egmont
still more, on this notice of records of Courts-Martial
not being preserved. The House sat till eight, but
came to no division.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;The King would not go to Chapel, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Secker, Bishop of Oxford, was to preach before him.
The Ministers did not insist upon his hearing the
sermon, as they had lately upon his making him Dean
of St. Paul’s. Character and popularity do not always
depend upon the circumstances that ought to compose
either. This Bishop, who had been bred a Presbyterian
and Man-midwife, which sect and profession he had
dropt for a season, while he was President of a very
free thinking club,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> had been converted by Bishop
Talbot,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> whose relation he married, and his faith
settled in a Prebend of Durham: from thence he was
transplanted, at the recommendation of Dr. Bland,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
by the Queen, and advanced by her [who had no
aversion to a medley of religions, which she always
compounded into a scheme of heresy of her own], to
the living of St. James’s, vacant by the death of her
favourite Arian, Dr. Clarke, and afterwards to the
Bishoprics of Bristol and Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> It is incredible
how popular he grew in his parish, and how much
some of his former qualifications contributed to
heighten his present doctrines. His discourses from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>the pulpit, which, by a fashion that he introduced,
were a kind of moral essays, were as clear from
quotations of Scripture, as when he presided in a less
Christian society; but what they wanted of Gospel,
was made up by a tone of fanaticism that he still retained.
He had made a match between a daughter
of the late Duke of Kent<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and a Doctor Gregory,
whose talents would have been extremely thrown away
in any priesthood, where celibacy was one of the injunctions.
He had been presented with a noble service
of plate for procuring a marriage between the
heiress<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> of the same Duke of Kent and the Chancellor’s
son, and was now forced upon the King<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> by the gratitude
of the same Minister, though he had long been
in disgrace for having laid his plan for Canterbury in
the interest he had cultivated at the Prince’s Court.
But even the Church had its renegades in politics, and
the King was obliged to fling open his asylum to all
kind of deserters; content with not speaking to them
at his levee, or listening to them in the pulpit!</p>

<p>12th.&mdash;Potter produced several Physicians and
Masters of Workhouses to prove the fatal consequences
of spirituous liquors, which laid waste the meaner parts
of the town, and were now spreading into the country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>Sir Joseph Jekyll had formerly carried through a Bill
against Gin, but with such danger from the populace,
that the Act had been established merely by military
force, and with little success, as informers against the
retailers of it had seldom escaped the vengeance of the
mob. Mr. Sandys,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> on succeeding Sir Robert Walpole,
had repealed this Act to increase the Revenue; but
being one of the acts of his short reign, to which he had
risen by deserting his party, he was as ill-treated by
the faction as the prohibition had been by the lower
people. Lord Hervey,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> who had turned patriot at
that season on being turned out of place, had made
three remarkably fine orations against the repeal; and
Sir Charles Williams had made a couple of ballads<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
with much wit, to ridicule both Sandys and Lord
Hervey. Mr. Pelham spoke now against the appearance
of the Physicians, &amp;c. as he believed no remedy could be
found for the evil, and yet imposing new duties would
greatly diminish the Revenue: but they were examined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>18th.&mdash;Mr. Fox acquainted the House that Mr.
Moncrief attended without, who was called in, and
delivered the original copy of the Court-Martial from
General Anstruther; and (as he was not able to come
in person, being above seventy, and laid up with a
rheumatism and pain in his bowels) an answer to Sir
Henry Erskine’s complaint, in which he acknowledged
the facts, but denied the aggravating circumstances.
That day se’nnight was appointed to consider the
charge and answer, and the Minutes of the Council;
after Sir Harry Erskine had declared he would say no
more, though if he chanced to prove more, it would
be but the more conspicuous: to which Mr. Fox replied,
that it would be fairer to acquaint Anstruther
with that <em>more</em>. Mr. Fox then moved, at Anstruther’s
desire, for a copy of a Resolution of Council against
Colonel Pinfold, a former Governor of Minorca, who
had been condemned to make satisfaction to the oppressed
parties, and had. Anstruther would have done
the like, but was prevented.</p>

<p>The Prince was dangerously ill.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: '19.--The'">19th.&mdash;The</ins> Council, which had been postponed, was
held at Bedford-house, whither the Duke of Newcastle
would have carried Lord Halifax and Lord Anson,
but the Duke of Bedford refused to admit them. It
was proposed to hear the whole Board of Trade upon
their Memorial; but the Duke of Bedford said, that
this proposal of stationing two men of war at Nova
Scotia, upon the notion of a French fleet going thither,
had not been mentioned in a long letter that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
received from that Board in January last, since which
period there had been no letters from Governor Cornwallis.
Nobody agreed with the Duke but Lord
Sandwich, not even his father-in-law, Lord Gower,
who had been with him an hour before the rest
arrived, and said to him, “Now we have caught
Lord Halifax in a trap;” (but he himself was intangled
in Mr. Pelham’s snares, and did not know
it!) nor the Duke of Marlborough, though his friend
and brother-in-law, and though his connexion with
Mr. Fox had made the Duke of Bedford flatter himself
with his support: but both the Duke and Lord
Sandwich were too sanguine about Mr. Fox, who had
declared to them, that if it came to a rupture, he must
adhere to Mr. Pelham. He had repeated this to
Lord Sandwich in the summer, when commissioned
by him to carry a reconciling message to Mr. Pelham.
Mr. Fox had made the same declaration of his unavoidable
connexion with Mr. Pelham to the Duke of
Cumberland: but the Duke of Bedford was not only
apt to forget what he did not care to hear, and even
to forget his own change of opinion, but would and
did often believe the very reverse. He told the two
brothers that this was designed as a hostile measure
against him, which they then denied.</p>

<p>20th.&mdash;Potter<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> opened in an able manner his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
scheme for an additional duty of two shillings on
spirits, to be collected by way of Excise. He was a
young man of the greatest goodnature, though he had
set out with two of the severest speeches<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> that ever
were made against the Ministry and the Grenvilles,
and with the greatest applause; but his goodnature
had kept up to its character much more than his
parts. He was not bashful nor void of vanity, and
had now flattered himself that he should figure like
Sir Robert Walpole by attempting to re-establish the
defeated Excise Scheme; not reflecting that the opposition
to that project was levelled at the Minister, not
occasioned by the pretended inconveniences and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
dangers of it. Mr. Pelham spoke greatly against it,
and for suppressing unlicensed houses, and for a
visitation by parish officers. He was seconded by
the Solicitor General. Alderman Baker, a man
rather busy and confident than very able, fluctuated
between both schemes: but Mr. Pelham desiring a
respite till the morrow se’nnight for further deliberation,
it was agreed to.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales had been ill of a pleurisy, but
was so well recovered as to attend the King to the
House of Lords on the 12th, where he was very hot.
He went to Carlton-house to unrobe, put on only a
light frock, and went to Kew, where he walked some
time, and returning to Carlton-house, laid down upon
a couch for three hours in a ground room next to the
garden, caught a fresh cold, and relapsed that night.
He had had a blow upon his stomach in the summer
by a fall, from which he had often felt great pains.
Dr. Wilmot, Taylor, and Leigh attended him, and
Hawkins the Surgeon. On Monday, 18th, a thrush
appeared; however, he was thought better. On Wednesday
night, between nine and ten o’clock, Wilmot
and Hawkins were with him; he had a fit of coughing.
Wilmot said, “Sir, you have brought up all
the phlegm; I hope this will be over in a quarter of
an hour, and that your Royal Highness will have a
good night.” Hawkins went out of the room, and
said, “Here is something I don’t like.” The cough
continued; the Prince laid his hand upon his
stomach, and said, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je sens la mort</i>.” Pavonarius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
his favourite German valet-de-chambre, who was
holding him up, felt him shiver, and cried, “Good
God! the Prince is going!” The Princess, who was
at the feet of the bed, snatched up a candle, but
before she got to him, he was dead! An imposthume
had broken, which, on his body being opened, the
Physicians were of opinion had not been occasioned
by the fall, but from a blow of a tennis-ball three
years before.</p>

<p>Thus died Frederick Prince of Wales! having
resembled his pattern the Black Prince in nothing
but in dying before his father. Indeed it was not
his fault if he had not distinguished himself by any
warlike achievements. He had solicited the command
of the Army in Scotland during the last Rebellion;
though that ambition was ascribed rather to
his jealousy of his brother than to his courage. A
hard judgment! for what he could he did! When
the Royal Army lay before Carlisle, the Prince, at a
great supper that he gave to his Court and his
favourites, as was his custom when the Princess laid
in, had ordered for the dessert the representation of
the citadel of Carlisle in paste, which he in person, and
the Maids of Honour, bombarded with sugar plums!
He had disagreed with the King and Queen early
after his coming to England; not entirely by his
own fault. The King had refused to pay what
debts he had left at Hanover; and it ran a little in
the blood of the family to hate the eldest son: the
Prince himself had so far not degenerated, though a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
better natured man, and a much better father, as to
be fondest of his second son, Prince Edward. The
Queen had exerted more authority, joined to a
narrow prying into his conduct, than he liked; and
Princess Emily, who had been admitted into his
greatest confidence, had not forfeited her duty to the
Queen by concealing any of his secrets that might do
him prejudice.</p>

<p>Lord Bolingbroke, who had sowed a division in the
Pretender’s Court, by the scheme for the father’s
resigning his claim to the eldest boy, repeated the
same plan of discord here, on the first notice of the
Prince’s disgusts; and the whole Opposition was instructed
to offer their services to the Heir Apparent
against the Crown and the Minister. The Prince
was sensible to flattery, and had a sort of parts that
made him relish the sort of parts of Lord Chesterfield,
Doddington, and Lyttelton, the latter of whom being
introduced by Doddington, had wrought the disgrace
of his protector. Whoever was unwelcome at St.
James’s was sure of countenance at the Prince’s apartments
there. He was in vain reprimanded for this
want of respect. At last, having hurried the Princess
from Hampton Court, when she was in actual labour,
to the imminent danger of hers and the child’s life,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
without acquainting either King or Queen, the formal
breach ensued; he having added to this insult, a total
silence to his mother on her arriving immediately to
visit the Princess, and while he led her to her coach;
but as soon as he came in sight of the populace, he
knelt down in the dirt and kissed her hand with the
most respectful show of duty. He immediately went
all lengths of opposition and popularity till the fall
of Sir Robert Walpole, when he was reconciled to,
though never after spoken to, by the King.</p>

<p>On Lord Granville’s disgrace, he again grew out of
humour; but after having been betrayed and deserted
by all he had obliged, he did not erect a new standard
of opposition, till the Pelhams had bought off
every man of any genius that might have promoted
his views. Indeed, his attachment to his followers
was not stronger than theirs to him. Being angry
with Lord Doneraile<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> for not speaking oftener in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
House of Commons, he said, “Does he think I will
support him, unless he does as I would have him?
Does not he consider that whoever are my Ministers,
I must be King?” His chief passion was women, but
like the rest of his race, beauty was not a necessary
ingredient. Miss <span class="nowrap">****,</span> whom he had debauched
without loving, and who had been debauched without
loving him so well as either Lord Harrington or Lord
Hervey, who both pretended to her first favours, had
no other charms than of being a Maid of Honour,
who was willing to cease to be so upon the first opportunity.</p>

<p>One of his favourites, Lady Archibald Hamilton<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
had been neither young nor handsome within his
memory. Lady Middlesex<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> was very short, very
plain, and very yellow: a vain girl, full of Greek and
Latin, and music, and painting, but neither mischievous
nor political. Lady Archibald was very agreeable
and artful, but had lost his heart, by giving him
William Pitt for a rival. But though these mistresses
were pretty much declared, he was a good husband,
and the quiet inoffensive good sense of the Princess
(who had never said a foolish thing, or done a disobliging
one since her arrival, though in very difficult
situations, young, uninstructed, and besieged
by the Queen, Princess Emily, and Lady Archibald’s
creatures, and very jarring interests), was likely to
have always preserved a chief ascendant over him.</p>

<p>Gaming was another of his passions, but his style of
play did him less honour than the amusement. He
carried this dexterity<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> into practice in more essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>commerce, and was vain of it! One day at Kensington
that he had just borrowed five thousand pounds of
Doddington, seeing him pass under his window, he
said to Hedges<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> his Secretary, “That man is reckoned
one of the most sensible men in England, yet with all
his parts, I have just nicked him out of five thousand
pounds.” He was really childish, affectedly a protector
of arts and sciences, fond of displaying what he
knew: a mimic, the Lord knows what a mimic!&mdash;of
the celebrated Duke of Orleans, in imitation of whom
he wrote two or three silly French songs.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> His best
quality was generosity; his worst, insincerity, and
indifference to truth, which appeared so early, that
Earl Stanhope wrote to Lord Sunderland from
Hanover, what I shall conclude his character with,
“He has his father’s head, and his mother’s heart.”</p>

<p>The Princess staid four hours in the room after he
was dead, before she could be quite convinced of it.
At six in the morning they put her to bed; but she
rose again at eight, and sent for Dr. Lee, and burnt,
or said she burnt, all the Prince’s papers. As soon as
he was dead, Lord North was sent to notify it to the
King, who was playing at cards. He immediately
went down to Lady Yarmouth, looking extremely
pale and shocked, and only said, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il est mort!</i>” He
sent a very kind message to the Princess, and another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>the next morning in writing by the Lord in Waiting,
Lord Lincoln. She received him alone, sitting with
her eyes fixed; thanked the King much, and said she
would write as soon as she was able; in the meantime,
recommended her miserable self and children to
him.</p>

<p>The King and she both took their parts at once;
she, of flinging herself entirely into his hands, and
studying nothing but his pleasure, but with winding
what interest she got with him to the advantage of
her own and the Prince’s friends: the King of acting
the tender grandfather; which he, who had never
acted the tender father, grew so pleased with representing,
that he soon became it in earnest. When he
was called the morning after the Prince’s death, they
found him drest, walking about his room, and extremely
silent. Princess Emily, who had no great
reason to flatter herself with much favour if her
brother had lived to be King, sent immediately for the
Duke from Windsor, who, on receiving the news, said
to Lord Sandwich with a sneer, “It is a great blow
to this country, but I hope it will recover it in time!”
He little thought that himself was to receive the
greatest shock from it! He sent a compliment by
Lord Cathcart to Prince George, who cried extremely.
As soon as the Prince’s death was published, elegies
were cried about the streets, to which they added,
“Oh, that it was but his brother!”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and upon Change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and in the city, “Oh, that it was but the butcher!”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
In short, the consternation that spread on the apprehensions
that the Duke would at least be Regent on
the King’s death, and have the sole power in the mean
time, was near as strong as what was occasioned by the
notice of the Rebels being at Derby.</p>

<p>The Houses met the next morning, but adjourned
without doing any thing.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford proposed to the King to remove
Dr. Ayscough from the young Princes, which he
much approved, and nobody but the Cobham cousins<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
disliked, who had just patched up their peace with the
Prince by his intervention. Lyttelton, whose sister
he had married, solicited Mr. Pelham to save him.
Mr. Pelham answered, “I know nothing of Dr.
Ayscough&mdash;oh, yes, I recollect, a very worthy man
told me in this room two years ago that he was a great
rogue!” It was Lyttelton himself who had quarrelled
with him about an election business. Ayscough, who
was an insolent man, unwelcome to the Clergy on suspicions
of heterodoxy, and of no fair reputation for
integrity, had been placed by Lyttelton and Pitt with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>the Prince, into whose favour he had worked himself,
chiefly by partialities to Prince Edward; and managed
his Privy Purse and his election affairs. The Princess,
finding that Prince George, at eleven years old, could
not read English, though Ayscough, to make amends,
assured her he could make Latin verses, had already
introduced a new Preceptor, one Scot, recommended
by Lord Bolingbroke, who had lately seen the Prince
two or three times in private.</p>

<p>22d.&mdash;The King sent a Commission to pass the
Mutiny Bill. Lord Egremont in the House of Lords,
and Lord Hilsborough in the Commons, moved the
Address of Condolence; and then the Lords adjourned
to Wednesday, and the Commons till Monday. Lord
Egremont, who was son to the great Sir William
Windham, and grandson to the old Duke of Somerset,
whose prodigious pride he inherited, more than his
father’s abilities, though he had a great deal of
humour, had formerly been a personal favourite with
the Prince, but had slighted that intimacy when Lord
Granville his patron would not co-operate in the
Prince’s last Opposition.</p>

<p>Lord Hilsborough was a young man of great
honour and merit, remarkably nice in weighing whatever
cause he was to vote in, and excellent at setting
off his reasons, if the affair was at all tragic, by a
solemnity in his voice and manner that made much
impression on his hearers.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock of the very morning after the
Prince expired, Lord Egmont sent cards to several of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the Opposition, desiring them to meet at his house, to
consult on the measures proper for them to take on the
present conjuncture. Many of them came. He did
not make any formal oration, but whispered most of
them something about taking upon themselves the
protection of the Princess and her children. The
meeting passed in a sort of dumb confusion and uncertainty,
and broke up without taking any measures
at all.</p>

<p>An Order of Council was made to omit the name of
the Prince of Wales in the prayers. As no rank was
yet given to Prince George, it created murmurs.
Though the House sat, nothing was done but private
business. On the 26th, Colonel Haldane moved, as
the Prince’s servants did not yet attend the House,
that Anstruther’s affair might be postponed till after
Easter, which was agreed to, though the General was
present, and earnest to have it heard sooner.</p>

<p>28th.&mdash;A Council was held at the Cockpit, on the
Nova-Scotia affair. They divided: the Chancellor,
Mr. Pelham, the Dukes of Newcastle, Grafton, Dorset,
and Argyle, were for complying with the request of
the Board of Trade; the Duke of Bedford and Lord
Sandwich, who had now got the Duke of Marlborough
and Lord Gower on their side, against it.</p>

<p>The German politics went ill. What Allies we had
there wanted more money. The Elector of Cologne,
who had signed a treaty with the King, refused to
execute it, and united with France. That Court used
continual evasions with us, on the evacuation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Tobago, and the contested islands in the West Indies,
and gave great disturbance to our Colony of Nova-Scotia.
In the east, they were driving us out of our
Settlements; and upon the coast of Africa seizing our
forts, raising others, inveigling away our Allies, and
working us out of our whole Negro and Gold-Coast
trade. The British Minister at Paris, Lord Albemarle,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
was not a man to offend the haughtiness of
that Court, or the pusillanimity of his own, by mixing
more sturdiness with his Memorials than he was commissioned
to do. It was convenient to him to be anywhere
but in England: his debts were excessive,
though he was Embassador, Groom of the Stole,
Governor of Virginia, and Colonel of a regiment of
Guards. His figure was genteel, his manner noble
and agreeable: the rest of his merit, for he had not
even an estate, was the interest my Lady Albemarle
had with the King through Lady Yarmouth, and his
son, Lord Bury, being the Duke’s chief favourite. He
had all his life imitated the French manners, till he
came to Paris, where he never conversed with a
Frenchman; not from partiality to his own countrymen,
for he conversed as little with them, living
entirely with a Flemish Columbine, that he had
brought from the Army. If good breeding is not
different from good sense, Lord Albemarle, who might
have disputed even that maxim, at least knew how to
distinguish it from good nature. He would bow to
his postilion, while he was ruining his tailor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>31st.&mdash;The King went to see the Princess. A chair
of state was placed for him, but he refused it, and sat
by her on the couch, embraced, and wept with her.
He would not suffer the Lady Augusta to kiss his
hand, but embraced her, and gave it to her brothers,
and told them, “They must be brave boys, obedient
to their mother, and deserve the fortune to which they
were born.”</p>

<p>
On Sunday, June 17, 1759, died Thomas Potter, Esq., joint

of Canterbury, Recorder of the city of Bath, and member in
the present Parliament for Okehampton in Devonshire.&mdash;(Public

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_74_74" id="Footnote_74_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> The first was on a petition for setting aside Mr. W. Pitt’s
election at Seaforth, where the Duke of Newcastle had appeared
at the poll, contrary to the resolution of the House of
Commons against Peers interfering in elections. It was printed
in the London Magazine, and old Horace Walpole published a
letter to him upon it. The other speech was on the famous bill
for removing the Assizes from Aylesbury to Buckingham, on a
contest between the Lord Chief Justice Willes and the Grenvilles.
Potter talking upon his plan for suppressing Gin, told a
near relation of Sir Robert Walpole, that he would imitate that
Minister, and expose himself to all the unpopularity of the
Excise Scheme. When Mr. Fox was told of this speech, he said
it put him in mind of Sir Godfrey Kneller, who, when his
gardener was cursing himself, said to him, “God d&mdash;n <em>you</em>!
God d&mdash;ns Kings and Princes and great men; God no d&mdash;n
such poor fellows as you.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> It was (Lady Augusta) the eldest, “afterwards Duchess of
Brunswick.” As it was necessary to have the Privy Councillors
present at the birth of an Heir-Apparent to the Crown, which
was prevented by this rash step, the Prince sent messengers, as
he was upon the road, to Chiswick and Lambeth, to fetch Lord
Wilmington and the Archbishop of Canterbury; but they arrived
too late. The Princess was put into a bed that had not been
prepared, for which the Prince and Lady Archibald Hamilton
were forced to air the sheets. The Queen followed them early
in the morning, and asked Lady Archibald, “how she dared to
bring away the Princess in that manner?” who turned to the
Prince, and said, “You see, Sir, I told you it would be laid upon
me.”</p></div>

Bedchamber to the Prince, died of a consumption at Lisbon in
1750. He was a young man of great parts, but of no steadiness
in courage, conduct, or principles. He made a celebrated speech
against the Pelhams, on the affair of the sixteen new regiments
that were to be raised by some Noblemen during the Rebellion.
These Lords had offered to raise them at their own expense, but
made a notorious job of it, at the same time that the Earl of
Kildare, who really meant it, was not permitted, as Lord Doneraile
by his authority acquainted the House of Commons, and
concluded with saying, that “the Ministry were either too weak
to do a right thing, or too good-natured to refuse a wrong
one.”</p></div>

Wales, and for some years governed absolutely at the Prince’s
Court. She had contrived to have the Princess told, before her
arrival in England, that Lady <span class="nowrap">****</span> was his mistress, to divert
any suspicions from herself; and had planted so many of her
own relations about her, that one day at Carlton-house, Sir William
Stanhope called everybody there whom he did not know,

soon after Mr. Pitt accepted a place in the Administration.</p></div>

One day, when the Prince was but a boy, his Governor was
complaining of him: the Queen, whose way (as the King said)
was to excuse him, said, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! je m’imagine que ces sont des

<p>April 2d.&mdash;Mr. Cooke moved in a very thin House,
and late in the day, to have Mr. Murray taken into
the custody of the Serjeant at Arms, on account of his
bad health. It was agreed to, and ordered that the
Speaker should give permission to whomever he
thought proper to visit him.</p>

<p>Lord Lincoln was made Auditor of the Exchequer,
in the room of the Earl of Orford,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> who was just dead.
Mr. Pelham had affected to be willing to retire with
this post, which is at least eight thousand pounds a
year, and a sinecure for life. The King desired him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
not to take it himself, and that dutiful Minister
obeyed; that is, he held it in the name of Lord
Lincoln,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> who was his nephew and son-in-law, adopted
heir to the Duke of Newcastle, and the mimic of his
fulsome fondnesses and follies, but with more honour
and more pride. As the Duke, his uncle, was a political
weathercock, he was a political weatherglass;
his quicksilver being always up at insolence, or down
at despair. Lyttelton asked to be Cofferer, if Lord
Lincoln resigned it. Mr. Pelham told him that, from
his and Pitt’s behaviour this winter, the King would
do nothing for him.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: '3.--Palmer'">3rd.&mdash;Palmer</ins> the deputy Serjeant-at-arms, reported
to the House that Dr. Lamont, who the day before
had represented Murray as ill of the jail distemper,
told him that the prisoner had been in a sweat, and
must not be removed; besides, that there was danger
of the motion causing a return of his vomiting; and
that on acquainting Mr. Murray with the indulgence
of the House, he replied, “He would not come out of
Newgate, and that it was mean and paltry in that
puppy, his brother, or any of his friends to petition for
his enlargement.” The House sent for Dr. Lamont,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
examined him again, and then voted a total revocation
of the preceding indulgence.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;The King went again to see the Princess,
and settled with her the new Governor and Preceptors
for the children. Lord North<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> had lately been
entrusted with the care of Prince George, with the
promise of an Earldom; an amiable worthy man, of no
great genius, unless compared with his successor. The
Pelhams, who had now laid a plan of perpetuating
that power, which by so many accidents had dropped
into their hands, determined to beset the young
Prince entirely with their own creatures. Lord
North was removed to make way for Lord Harcourt,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
who wanted a Governor himself, as much as
the Duke of Newcastle was likely to do by parting
with Stone, who was to be the real engine of their
policy, while Lord Harcourt, who was civil and
sheepish, did not threaten them with traversing their
scheme, or teaching the young Prince other arts
than what he knew himself&mdash;hunting and drinking.
Stone,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> lately grown a personal favourite with the
King during the journeys to Hanover, was a dark,
proud man, very able and very mercenary. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>other Preceptor was Hayter, Bishop of Norwich, a
sensible, well-bred man, natural son of Blackbourn,
the jolly old Archbishop of York, who had all the
manners of a man of quality, though he had been a
Buccaneer and was a Clergyman; but he retained
nothing of his first profession except his seraglio.
Lord Hartington had been offered the government of
the Prince, but declined it.</p>

<p>The late Prince’s debts, which were supposed very
great, were extremely denied, and concealed as carefully
as they would have been vaunted by those who
had laid that foundation of their future advancement,
if he had lived to be King. The Hanoverians, who
were said to have lent him considerable sums, took
care not to be the most clamorous for repayment. All
who had flattered themselves with rising in his reign,
by being so insignificant at present as to have no
other support, were extremely disappointed at losing
their only prospect. Some Peerages were still-born,
more First-ministerships, and sundry regiments and
inferior posts. Drax, his Secretary, who could not
write his own name; Lord Baltimore, who, with a
great deal of mistaken knowledge, could not spell;
and Sir William Irby, the Princess’s Polonius, were
to be Barons. Doddington,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> it is said, had actually
kissed his hand for the reversion of a Dukedom.
This man, with great knowledge of business, much wit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and great parts, had, by mere absurdity of judgment,
and a disposition to finesse, thrown himself out of all
estimation, and out of all the great views which his
large fortune and abilities could not have failed to
promote, if he had but preserved the least shadow of
steadiness. He had two or three times alternately gone
all lengths of flattery with Sir Robert Walpole and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Prince of Wales. The latter and he had met again
at last in a necessary connexion, for no party would
have anything to do with either.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Lord Chief Justice Willes was designed for Chancellor.
He had been raised by Sir Robert Walpole,
though always brow-beaten by haughty Yorke, and
hated by the Pelhams, for that very attachment to
their own patron. As Willes’s nature was more open,
he returned their aversion with little reserve. He
was not wont to disguise any of his passions. That
for gaming was notorious; for women, unbounded.
There was a remarkable story current of a grave person’s
coming to reprove the scandal he gave, and
to tell him that the world talked of one of his maid
servants being with child. Willes said, “What is
that to me?” The monitor answered, “Oh! but
they say that it is by your Lordship.” “And what is
that to you?” He had great quickness of wit, and a
merit that would atone for many foibles, his severity
to, and discouragement of that pest of society,
Attorneys: hence his Court was deserted by them; and
all the business they could transport, carried into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Chancery, where Yorke’s filial piety would not refuse
an asylum to his father’s profession.</p>

<p>The Council forgetting that it was the Duke’s birth-day,
appointed the 15th for the Prince’s funeral, but
changed it to the 13th, when it was performed with
the usual state.</p>

<p>Dr. Lee<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> was made Treasurer to the Princess,
against the inclination of the Pelhams; but the Duke
of Newcastle soon began to pay such court to him, and
he to be so pleased with it, that they were satisfied.
He was a man of great integrity, and had preserved
it through all the late changes. His election to be
Chairman of the Committee of Privileges and Elections
was the first instance of Sir Robert Walpole’s
declining power; he had been made a Lord of the
Admiralty by Lord Granville and Lord Bath, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
had resigned with the former, notwithstanding great
offers from his antagonists. The Prince had designed
him for Chancellor of the Exchequer, a post for which
he was little qualified; for though he was a speaker of
great weight in Parliament, which was set off with a
solemn harmonious voice, and something severe in his
style, his business of civilian had confined him to too
narrow a sphere for the extensive knowledge of men
that is requisite to a Prime Minister.</p>

<p>16th.&mdash;Lord Waldegrave<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> was made Warden of the
Stannaries in the room of T&mdash;&mdash; P&mdash;&mdash;, a bad man;
never was ill-nature so dull as his, never dullness so
vain. Lord Waldegrave on the contrary, had complaisance
enough to have covered folly or ill-nature,
though in him it only concealed a very good understanding,
and made his good-nature the less observed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
He was a personal favourite of the King, who
had long wished for an opportunity to serve him.
Potter resigned his employment of Secretary to the
Princess, which was restored to Cresset, who was
her chief favourite, and related to the Royal Family
by a Duchess of Zelle,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> who had come from somewhere
in the provinces of France. Scott was continued a
Sub-preceptor.</p>

<p>The Naturalization Bill was thrown out at nine
o’clock at night on the third reading, by 129 to 116.
The Duke of Bedford’s people had staid away; the
Wiltshire members, the Welsh, and the Tories
to a man were against it. Pitt and Fox had again
some sparring: people could not help smiling to see
Cæsar and Pompey squabbling, when they had nothing
to say.</p>

<p>Pitt<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> was undoubtedly one of the greatest masters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>of ornamental eloquence. His language was amazingly
fine and flowing; his voice admirable; his action most
expressive; his figure genteel and commanding.
Bitter satire was his forte: when he attempted ridicule,
which was very seldom, he succeeded happily;
when he attempted to reason, poorly. But where he
chiefly shone, was in exposing his own conduct: having
waded through the most notorious apostasy in
politics, he treated it with an impudent confidence,
that made all reflections upon him poor and spiritless,
when worded by any other man. Out of the House
of Commons he was far from being this shining character.
His conversation was affected and unnatural,
his manner not engaging, nor his talents adapted to a

<p>Fox,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> with a great hesitation in his elocution, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
a barrenness of expression, had conquered these impediments
and the prejudices they had raised against his
speaking, by a vehemence of reasoning, and closeness
of argument, that beat all the orators of the time.
His spirit, his steadiness, and humanity procured him
strong attachments, which the more jealous he grew
of Pitt, the more he cultivated. Fox always spoke
to the question, Pitt to the passions: Fox, to carry
the question; Pitt, to raise himself: Fox pointed out,
Pitt lashed the errors of his antagonists: Pitt’s talents
were likely to make him soonest, Fox’s to keep him
First Minister longest.</p>

(who had succeeded to the confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of Lord Townshend, Sir Robert Walpole, and
Mr. Pelham, as they succeeded one another in power,
and had already laid a foundation with Mr. Fox) was
appointed Treasurer to the Prince, as he and his son
were already to the Duke and Princesses. He was a
shrewd silent man, humane, and reckoned very honest&mdash;he
might be so&mdash;if he was, he did great honour to
the cause, for he had made his court and his fortune
with as much dexterity as those who reckon virtue
the greatest impediment <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'to wordly success'">to worldly success</ins>.</p>

<p>Anstruther’s affair came on. George Townshend
moved to address the King to enforce the sentence of
the Privy Council, and oblige him to make compensation
to those he had oppressed and despoiled.
Mitchell opposed the Motion; Pitt spoke well in behalf
of it, and it was agreed to without a division; and
the further consideration deferred to the Wednesday
following.</p>

<p>Sir John Molesworth and Sir Robert Burdett, two
Tory members, complained to the House of having
been carried by a Constable to St. Martin’s roundhouse
as they were walking home, and kept there all
night. At five in the morning, Carne, the High Constable,
who had been very active against Lord Trentham,
offered to release them on promise of their
taking no revenge, which they refused. The Constable
was taken into custody, and Carne too, after
a short debate, the Whigs being very zealous to
vindicate the honour of the Tory members against a
Tory High Constable. He was released the next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Bathurst<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and Joddrell were continued Attorney
and Solicitor to the Princess. Bathurst was an
unpleasant, but sometimes a good speaker. Joddrell
was a very rising man, but died soon after, and was
succeeded by Henley, who was a lawyer in vogue, but
his abilities did not figure in proportion to the impudence
of his ill-nature. Douglas and Boone (in the
room of Sir John Cust, who was soon after restored
on the death of Douglas) were named to the Green
Cloth, and Bloodworth had the sole direction of the
Stables. The King offered the Princess a Master of
the Horse, but told her it must be a Nobleman, and
there was one to whom he had an objection: This
was Lord Middlesex.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> She desired none; if she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>been disposed to contend, it would not have been of
all men in favour of the Lord in question. His figure,
which was handsome, had all the reserve of his family,
and all the dignity of his ancestors. He was a poet,
too, because they had been poets. As little as he came
near them in this talent, it was what he most resembled
them in, and in what he best supported their
honour. His passion was the direction of operas, in
which he had not only wasted immense sums, but had
stood lawsuits in Westminster Hall with some of those
poor devils for their salaries. The Duke of Dorset
had often paid his debts, but never could work upon
his affections; and he had at last carried his disobedience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
so far, in complaisance to, and in imitation of
the Prince, as to oppose his father in his own
boroughs. That Duke,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> with the greatest dignity in
his appearance, was in private the greatest lover of
low humour and buffoonery. He had early lost the
hearts of the Whigs by some indirect connexions with
Lord Oxford in the end of Queen Anne’s reign; and
he was never thought to have wanted a tendency to
power, in whatever hands it was, or was likely to be
lodged.</p>

<p>The people had idly imagined that advantage
would be made of the youth of the Prince’s children
to raise the Duke to the Throne. Nobody had doubted
but he must be Protector if the King should die
during their minority. All the precedents ran in his
favour, except two Acts which had never taken place,
made in the reign of King Henry the Eighth, for
appointing Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour Regents
during the eventual minorities of their respective
children. No woman had ever yet been Regent in a
minority. Even the Black Prince’s widow, though of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the most distinguished virtue and character, though
an English woman, and of the Blood Royal of England
herself, was passed over, and her son regented by his
uncles. The King, who never thought of disturbing
the right order of succession, and who grew a little
jealous of the Duke the moment he had lost his other
son, had, immediately on the Prince’s death, proposed
to have the future Regency settled by Parliament.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford, though connected with, and
wishing well to the Duke, and upon no terms with
the Princess, had the honesty to be the first man that
declared for her being Regent. The Pelhams took
care not to disagree with him on this article. The
Duke<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> had broke entirely with the Duke of Newcastle
towards the end of the war, when Lord Sandwich
having been ordered to communicate a new plan to
Count Kaunitz, had desired to be excused, but the
orders being repeated, he had obeyed artfully. The
Duke thought him in the wrong, and had received his
consent to say everything that might reconcile him
to the Duke of Newcastle, but that he thought himself
in the wrong. The Duke of Newcastle had neither
accepted nor refused the Duke’s mediation, who was
not apt to pardon slighter offences than contempt.
He loved indiscriminate submission; flattery did not
come up to his ideas of obedience, and consequently
he overlooked it: but the least opposition he never
forgave. With the most heroic bravery, he had all
the severity that levels valour to cowardice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
seemed to love war for itself, without feeling the passions
that it gratifies.</p>

<p>It is certain that his martial genius did not proceed
from love of glory, nor much from ambition. Glory
he despised, saying, “That when he was most popular,
the satisfaction was allayed, by thinking on Admiral
Vernon!”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and he had taken every step to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
himself unpopular both with the people and the Army;
and thought it so much beneath his rank to have any
share in the Ministry, that he would not be of the
Cabinet Council, and even when desired to attend
their consultations for the Expedition to Port L’Orient,
he would not vouchsafe to give his opinion, but confined
himself to answering their questions. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
strongest principle was the dignity of the Blood Royal,
and his maxim to bear anything from his brother if
he had lived to be King, rather than set an example
of disobedience to the royal authority. These prejudices
and this pride were the swellings of his heart
and temper, not the errors of his head, for his understanding
was strong, judicious, and penetrating,
though incapable of resisting partialities and piques,
of which he was susceptible from the slightest merit,
or most trifling offence. He was as angry at an Officer’s
transgressing the minutest precept of the military
rubric as at deserting his post, and was as intent on
establishing the form of spatter-dashes, or the pattern
of cockades, as on taking a town, or securing an
advantageous situation.</p>

<p>The misfortunes<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> the nation had suffered from his
inexperience while he commanded in Flanders had
been amply atoned by his defeating the Rebels in Scotland;
but that victory made him in the end more
unpopular than all his defeats; for the Scotch, the
Jacobites, and his brother’s jealousy never rested till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
they had propagated such stories of his tyranny and
severity, as entirely lost him the hearts of the nation.
He bore that hatred mildly, and said, “That so far from
resenting it (though he did not know, since he came
from Flanders, that he had deserved either praise or
blame) he should always with gratitude remember the
behaviour of the English, who received him with
transports after the battle of Laffelt, instead of impeaching
him.” It is said, that after the loss of that
day, an English captive telling a French Officer, that
they had been very near taking the Duke prisoner,
the Frenchman replied, “We took care of that; he
does us more service at the head of your Army.”
General Legonier,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> who, by an action of the most desperate
gallantry, had prevented the total destruction
of our troops in that battle, and almost made Marshal
Saxe doubt of his victory, was never kindly treated
by the Duke afterwards. Hawley,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> his executioner,
who had been beat at Falkirk by his own arrogance
and obstinacy, was always in his favour. He despised
money, fame, and politics; loved gaming, women, and
his own favourites, and yet had not one sociable
virtue.</p>

<p>The Pelhams taking advantage of this national
antipathy to the Duke; of their own superiority in
Parliament, which was now enforced by the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>part of the late Prince’s faction; and of a Hanoverian
regulation, by which the nearest male relation must
be Administrator of that Electorate during a minority,
and consequently the Duke’s presence necessary there,
even if the King of Prussia should not pretend
to the Government in case of his absence, yet as so
formidable a neighbour would be too dangerous to an
infant Elector, an apprehension that they well knew
would easily make its way into the King’s breast,
where hatred and fear of his nephew were already sufficiently
implanted; by these arts and insinuations they
worked upon the King to nominate the Princess, Regent,
with a Council; and the Lord Chancellor was deputed
from the King to communicate the plan to the Duke.
He went in a great fright: the Duke read the scheme,
and asked if he must send an answer. The Chancellor
hesitated, and did not make a direct reply.
However, the Duke desired “He would return his
duty and thanks to the King for the communication
of the plan of Regency;” and said, “For the part
allotted to me, I shall submit to it, because he commands
it, be that Regency what it will!” The Duke
bad Mr. Fox tell Mr. Pelham this answer, and remember
the word <em>submit</em>; adding, “It was a
material word; the Chancellor will remember it,
however he reports it.”</p>

<p>The Duke felt the force of this treatment in the
most sensible manner, and lamented himself in moving
terms with his intimates, wishing “the name of
William could be blotted out of the English annals;”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and saying, “He now felt his own insignificance, when
even Mr. Pelham would dare to use him thus!”</p>

<p>From this moment he openly declared his resentment
to the two brothers, and professed being ready
to connect with, nay, to forgive any man, who would
oppose them, even Lord Granville, who was not at
all unwilling to overset their power, though till that
could be done conveniently, he thought it as well to
unite with them. Lord Granville had, during his
short and precipitate Ministry, offended the Duke,
not only by negotiating a match for him with the
King of Denmark’s sister, to favour some of the King’s
German views, but had treated him roughly enough,
on his expressing an aversion to that marriage, and
had told him, he must be taught his duty to his
father. The Duke consulted Sir Robert Walpole,
then retired from business, how to avoid this wedding.
Sir Robert advised him to seem willing to
consent, provided the King would immediately make
him a large settlement. The Duke took the advice,
and had no reason to repent it. The King would
not part with his money, as Sir Robert Walpole had
foreseen, even to purchase advantages for Hanover.</p>

<p>A mortification of a slighter sort followed soon
after the Regency Bill, that showed the Duke in
what light he had appeared at his brother’s Court.
Prince George making him a visit, asked to see his
apartment, where there are few ornaments but arms.
The Duke is neither curious nor magnificent. To
amuse the boy, he took down a sword and drew it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
The young Prince turned pale and trembled, and
thought his uncle was going to murder him. The
Duke was extremely shocked, and complained to the
Princess of the impressions that had been instilled
into the child against him.</p>

<p>23rd&mdash;Mr. Pelham proposed some further restrictions
on the sale of Gin; slight ones indeed for
so enormous an evil! They were ratified.</p>

<p>24th.&mdash;General Anstruther’s cause came on, and
several witnesses attended, according to the orders of
the House. Sir Henry Erskine moved to call in
Brigadier Ofarel. Sir William Yonge objected to it,
saying, “He knew that what he was going to propose
would be disagreeable both to the gentleman who
had brought the charge, and to the gentleman accused;
but that it concerned the honour of the whole
House, and therefore he must first desire to know of
the gentlemen of the Law, whether the crimes specified
were not comprehended within the pardon of the late
Act of Grace.” Sir Henry Erskine protested that he
had no vindictive motive, but that he must desire to
have his cause heard; and asked whether the Act of
Grace was not known, or had not been mentioned
before, that now he was prepared to prove his
accusation, he was to be put off in this injurious
manner? General Anstruther agreed with him in
desiring to have the cause heard, which he affirmed
was a malicious, false, and scandalous accusation, particularly
in charging him with subornation of witnesses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of which, he said, none could be guilty but
they who charged it on others.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General said, “He must enter his
protest against complaints in these circumstances;
that there were two very striking in this complaint;
one, that the charge exhibited was of a private nature;
the other, that the facts alleged were previous in time
to the Act of Indemnity. That the House of Commons
is not a Court of Appeal; that this ‘is’ a case
of false imprisonment; that there are neither general
nor particular words in the Act of Grace to except it;
that no punishment can follow, even if the General
should be convicted, and we should address for it.
That the two Houses of Parliament can have no
mental reservation to pardon for the King, and not
for themselves; and, lastly, that the House of Commons
is not a Court of Inquiry into the characters of
its own members.” Sir Henry Erskine said, “That
he supposed Anstruther had been apprised of this
objection, or he would not have used such epithets on
the charge, if he had believed the witnesses would be
heard, who would prove the allegations; but that he
yet could furnish crimes, from which the Act of Grace
would not screen him.”</p>

<p>Lord George Sackville<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> said, “The Officers were
concerned to have this affair inquired into; that if
the General did not disculpate himself, could Officers
with honour serve under him? that he was sensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of the difficulty of not being able to punish him; and
therefore would give his negative to calling in Ofarel,
but proposed to have Anstruther tried by a Board of
General Officers.” Henley (the profession out-weighing
the faction in him) declared the House could exercise
no jurisdiction in this case, where the crimes were
misdemeanours; and that even if both parties should
consent to go before a Judge, he would be bound ex-officio
to dismiss the complaint. Lord Strange,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> a
busy young Lord, very disinterested, often quick, as
often injudicious, and not the less troublesome for
either, proposed at least to declare, that the Act of
Grace was the reason of not proceeding; and that if
the House would take no cognizance of this affair, it
might be heard by the Board of Officers. Nugent, too,
was tender of infringing the Act of Grace, and sorry if
he had been one to call improperly on Sir Harry to
make the charge. He said, “He had been told that
offences against the Mutiny Bill were to be pardoned
only from the year 43, but that the crimes in question
were antecedent to that era; if not, that the accused
must plead the Act. That for himself he should vote
for Lord George’s Motion.”</p>

<p>Anstruther said, “I plead nothing as to the Act of
Grace, but desire the House to take it into their consideration.”
Sir Richard Loyd, a lawyer, said, “This
was a misdemeanour, and a pardoned one; that the
prosecution of it now would affect numbers. An angry
court would have acted so formerly; should a House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of Commons act with such narrow microscopic eyes?
We want no pardon; many of our constituents may.
An Act of Grace does not merely take away punishment,
but restores a criminal so fully, that to call a pardoned
Rebel perjured, he would have an action. But it is
said, we may inspect: for what end, if no consequence
can follow? The Clergy took this up once, on the
misbehaviour of one of their own body, from whom
they would have taken orders, saying, they could not
serve with him; but the King’s Bench deeming it a
punishment, would not suffer it. In the reign of
James II. a Mr. Bayne was sequestered by the House
for his unworthiness; but was restored to his seat by
an Act of Grace. If you have a mind to hear angry
words for some hours, without doing anything, you
certainly may, but his offence is neither against the
Mutiny Bill, nor within the excepted term; nor can
he, being included within the Act of Grace, wave the
advantage of it.” He concluded, begging pardon of
the House with a sneer, for endeavouring to stop an
inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. W. Pitt said that if he had wanted information
upon the Act of Grace, he should have fully received
it, though he had never thought of infringing that;
but that he had been desirous of inquiring into the
nature of the General’s tyranny, in order to new model
the Mutiny Bill, if it were necessary. That he wanted
to see the minutes of the Court-Martial for information,
not for foundation of a criminal prosecution. That without
the impediment of the Act of Grace, he should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
against calling in Ofarel, as the business of the House
was not to hear causes that are without our jurisdiction,
but to find deficiencies in our laws, and remedies for
them. That, if this infringed the liberty of two
members, at least it was relative to what had happened
before they were so. That he had perceived
there was something in the dark, yet had not been the
loudest to call for what others, whose situation was
more connected with military matters, might know
better. That to send this to a Board of Officers would
be constituting the crime anew: that all he desired
was, that Governors in our Plantations and Foreign
Garrisons might know that the prosecution of this
affair was stopped by the Act of Grace, and might
tremble for the future. The hint towards the latter
end of the speech was levelled at Fox, the Secretary
at War, an employment that Pitt professed wishing to
have preferably to Paymaster, though the latter ‘was’
so much more considerable in profit, as it would give
him an introduction to the closet; the very reason
why the King had refused it to him. Pitt was so
much mortified at the King’s never speaking to him,
that above a year before this the Pelhams had with
great difficulty obtained a word to him at the levee.</p>

<p>Sir John Mordaunt, an Officer of gallantry, with
some wit, said, he had early spoke his mind for hearing
this cause, and had come determined to hear the witnesses,
but had changed his opinion, because of the
impropriety there would be of letting him continue a
member if he was proved guilty, an objection that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
would hold equally against trying him by a Board of
General Officers; a trial that he disliked, as to clear
the reputation of soldiers, he wished to have them
tried by any but Officers. That he saw the Crown
would be under the same difficulties as the House, and
therefore he agreed with Lord Strange’s motion for declaring
the Act of Grace the impediment. Fazakerley,
a tiresome Jacobite lawyer, was clear that he was
comprized within the general pardon; and yet for the
honour of the House was for doing something, and
that something was to try him, that the King might
not trust him any longer.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham said, “That if he were for trying him
by a Board of Officers, he should not be hindered by
the Act of Grace, which had been originally his opinion
as the properest way of carrying the cause before the
King; but that it must now rest here, as all the lawyers
were agreed on its being a violation of the general
indemnity. That so far from desiring with Fazakerley
that the King should remember it, he wished the
whole case could be obliterated; and that this might
go no further between the two persons, whom he begged
to bury in oblivion their private resentments, as the
House was obliged to do those of the public.” The
Speaker took up this, observed on the harsh words
that had passed, and desired they would be publicly
reconciled. Sir Henry Erskine answered, “The General
gave the offence.” The General replied, “I gave no
offence: I said the accusation was false and malicious;
does not my very denial of the charge say the same?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
The Chair insisted on their engaging to carry this
quarrel no further; to which Anstruther answered,
“I shall take no further notice.” The Speaker said,
“Do you give your honour?” Anstruther; “I do.”
Sir Harry Erskine said pertly, “I thought he would
have made an apology.” Sir William Yonge interrupted
him, and told him, he must not enter into a
discussion of what had passed; and the Chair insisted
on Sir Harry’s giving the proper assurances; on which
Sir Harry at last said dryly, “I give my honour in
consequence.” Lord Strange then repeated his Motion
for a declaration of the reasons of not proceeding.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox told him, “He was sorry to hear such a
Motion after so wise a conclusion; and that it would
be giving a reason for all, which was not the reason
of many. That the accusation was nothing before
reduced to writing; that he still thought it a frivolous
affair; that it could not be said Sir Harry was unwilling
to present the charge, as he had repeated the
accusation day after day; that Anstruther could call
it nothing but false or true; that he had frequently
been intreated by the General to get the cause heard;
and would now give him a word of comfort, that he
had thought him much more guilty before the charge
was presented&mdash;‘and’ now did not think him guilty
of a thousandth part of what he had been accused.
That as to the Motion, no vote ever passes for a
single reason; that this would be introducing a new
practice; and he concluded with asking whether the
House would permit Anstruther to enter upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Journals a complaint against the charge?” Sir Henry
Erskine said to that, “That there were accusations
in the answer as well as in the charge.” General
Oglethorpe<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>, of whom it was uncertain whether he
was a Whig or a Jacobite, whether very brave or a
coward, for he had fought several duels, and had run
away in the Rebellion; very certain that he was a
troublesome and tiresome speaker, though even that
was now and then tempered with sense; took notice
that if it were mentioned in the votes that the Act of
Grace had been read apropos to this Debate, it would
sufficiently explain without a further comment why
the affair was dropped. Lord Strange owned himself
content with this remark, and withdrew his Motion.
The House adjourned at half an hour after eight.</p>

in business, and was at the Court of Spain very young with Sir
Paul Methuen, who left him there to sign the treaty of Madrid.
He flattered Sir Robert Walpole extravagantly, and wrote that
epistle to him, from whence Pope quoted the famous line, where
he calls him the bard,
</p>

<p class="pad4">In power a servant, out of power a friend.</p>

<p>
However, being refused a Peerage, the great object of his ambition,
he broke with the Minister, and attached himself to the
Prince of Wales, but was undermined by Lyttelton. He renewed
his connexions with Sir Robert Walpole, and was made a Lord
of the Treasury; but deserted him again on his decline, and
contributed greatly to carry the western elections in 1741,
against the Court. He continued in Opposition during Lord
Granville’s administration; but came into place again on the
Coalition, and was Treasurer of the Navy. However, he again
quitted the Court, and renewed his engagements with the
Prince, and had a new place erected for him at Leicester House,
that of Treasurer of the Chambers, for which, when he went to
kiss hands at St. James’s, the King burst out a laughing in his
face. The Prince’s family were exceedingly averse to receive
him again amongst them, and treated him with great contempt,
which made Nugent, but a little before the Prince’s death, tell
the Princess, that he thought, considering Doddington was
united with them, that he was too ill treated there. She replied
with warmth, “However the Prince himself treats him, depend
upon it he can never forgive him. He knows that even since
his coming this last time into his service, he has said of the
Prince, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il a une telle tête, et un tel cœur, qu’on ne peut rien faire

standing in the circle, the Princess passed him without
speaking; the Prince just spoke to him, but affected to cough,
and walked on; the little Princes, less apprized of his history,
and accustomed to see him there, talked a good deal to him.
Charles Townshend, who stood behind and observed this scene,
leaned forward, and in a half whisper, cried, “Doddington, you
are d&mdash;d well with the youngest.”</p></div>

<p>
Sir George Lee was the fifth son of Sir Thomas Lee, of
Hartwell, in Buckinghamshire, Bart., by Alice, daughter and
heir of Mr. Hopkins, of London, merchant; and youngest brother
to the late Lord Chief Justice Lee. He represented the
borough of Brackley in the seventh, eighth, and ninth Parliaments
of Great Britain, and on the 16th of December, 1741,
was elected Chairman of the Committee of Elections in the
honourable House of Commons by a majority of two only against
Giles Earle, Esq.; and upon the change of the Ministry in
March following, was appointed a Lord of the Admiralty, which
vacating his seat in Parliament, he was in July following chosen
for Devizes. In the tenth Parliament he served for Leskard, in
Cornwall.
</p>
<p>
Upon the establishment of the Princess of Wales’s Household,
he was in April, 1751, appointed Treasurer to her Royal Highness,
which he resigned in the year 1757.

<p>
In December, 1751, on the decease of Dr. John Bettesworth,
he was appointed, by Archbishop Herring, Dean of the Arches,
and Judge of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, and in
February following his Majesty was pleased to confer upon him
the honour of Knighthood.</p></div>

Sir R. Walpole at the time of the Excise, when his kinsman,
Lord Cobham, lost his regiment for opposing that scheme. He
was then made Groom of the Bedchamber to the Prince of
Wales. The old Duchess of Marlborough left him ten thousand
pounds, and her grandson, Mr. Spencer, entailed the Sunderland
estate upon him after his own son. When Sir Robert
Walpole resigned, and Mr. Pulteney was created an Earl, Mr.
Pitt said, “He now knew his place in the House of Commons.”
He continued in Opposition, and distinguished himself greatly
against the Hanover troops, and personally against Lord Granville,
till the fall of that Minister. On the coalition, he pretended
to desire nothing for himself; but as soon as his junto
were placed in good employments, he began opposing again, till
in a very short time he was made Vice Treasurer of Ireland,
and was designed for Secretary at War, which the King (at the
instance of Lord Bath) refusing to make him, occasioned the
revolution of three days in 1746; soon after which he was made
Paymaster of the Forces on the death of Mr. Winnington, the
King persisting in not letting him have any place that could

James’s Street, his Grace Charles Sackville, Duke of Dorset, in
the 58th year of his age. His Grace received the first rudiments
of his education at Westminster School, in which he was
introduced by the late celebrated Prior, and there gave strong
indication of genius. The Duke afterwards visited France and
Italy, with the latter of which countries he was particularly
delighted, being accompanied by the late learned and very benevolent
Mr. Spence, who cherished the love which his Grace
naturally bore to the Polite Arts. At his return from his travels,
he encouraged learning and learned men. The Duke was
honoured with the esteem and affection of the late much-lamented
Prince Frederick, and it was thought that his Grace
would have made a very considerable figure in the State. He
was skilled not only in the learned languages, but also in the
modern. He had not the talent of speaking in public, so was
not distinguished in the House of Commons; but he was a fine
prose writer, of which (among other pieces) his Treatise concerning
the Militia is a proof. Some few printed specimens of
his poetry show his happy talent for that engaging art; and
especially the manuscript pieces left behind him, which, it is
hoped, will not be lost to the world. The Duke had laboured,
during many years, under a complication of distempers, and was
carried off in a fit. The excruciating pains with which he had
been long afflicted made life uncomfortable; however, those who
were acquainted with his former days, image to themselves the
learned, the polite, and entertaining companion, whose affability
was very attractive, as it threw off (in his presence) all distinction,
that of superior merit excepted. But, alas! sickness, disgust,
and disappointment, are apt to sour the sweetest dispositions.&mdash;(Public

</p>
<p>
His Grace is succeeded in title and estate by the Hon. John
Frederick Sackville (son of the late Lord John Philip Sackville,
second son of Lionel Cranfield, first Duke of Dorset), and
Knight of the Shire in the present Parliament for the county of
Kent.</p></div>

coming one day into the Kit Cat Club (it was about the time

<p><a name="Footnote_103_103" id="Footnote_103_103"></a><a href="#FNanchor_103_103"><span class="label">[103]</span></a> Edward Vernon, a silly, noisy Admiral, who, towards the
beginning of the war with Spain, was rash enough to engage to
take Porto Bello with six ships only, and rash enough to accomplish
his engagement; which made him so popular, that, notwithstanding
his failing soon afterwards in an attempt upon
Carthagena, and after that, more blameably upon Cuba, by
his dissensions with General Wentworth, he was chosen into
Parliament for several places, had his head painted on every
Sign, and his birth-day kept twice in one year. Yet as his
courage was much greater than his sense, his reputation was
much greater than his courage. One should have thought that
the lightness of his head would have buoyed up his heart in any
extremity! He had withdrawn himself but very awkwardly
from two or three private quarrels, and lost his public character
with still greater infamy; for being out of humour with the
Admiralty, he published a series of letters and instructions from
that Board in the very heat of the Rebellion, by which he betrayed
our spies&mdash;[It was believed that one of them was actually
hanged in France, he being never heard of after this transaction]&mdash;and
intelligence to the French, and was removed from
all command with ignominy. He raised great wealth by the
war, and by his economy, and was at last chosen one of the
Directors of the New Herring Fisheries, which occasioned the
following epigram:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p class="verse">And bad him rule o’er Billingsgate and fish.</p>

<p>
October 31, 1757.&mdash;Sunday last, died at his seat, at Nacton,
in Suffolk, Edward Vernon, Esq., member of Parliament for
Ipswich, and elder brother of the Trinity-house. In the sixth
and seventh Parliaments of Great Britain he represented the
borough of Penryn, in the eighth the town of Portsmouth. On
the 20th of July, 1739, he sailed from Portsmouth for the West
Indies with nine men-of-war and a sloop; and on the 5th of
November following sailed from Jamaica with the Burford,
Hampton Court, Princess Louisa, Strafford, Norwich, and Sheerness;
and on the 21st of the same month took the fort of Porto
Bello; as also Gloria Castle, and Castle of St. Jeronimo, with
five ships only (the Sheerness being then cruising off Carthagena),
with the loss of only seven persons killed, and twelve
wounded. In this expedition the principal engineer in the
mining work was Captain (now Admiral) Knowles of the Diamond,
assisted by Captain (now Admiral) Boscawen, who desired
he might serve in this expedition as a Volunteer, his ship the
Shoreham not being then fit for the sea. For this service the
Admiral had the Thanks of both Houses of Parliament, was
presented with the Freedom of the city of London in a gold box;
and in the ninth Parliament of Great Britain, summoned to
meet the 25th of June, 1741, was returned for the city of
Rochester and borough of Ipswich, but made his election for
Ipswich, which he also represented in the last, and in the present
Parliament. After the affair of Porto Bello, he took Chagre,
and continued in his Majesty’s service till the year 1748, when
several matters which had passed between the Lords of the
Admiralty and Mr. Vernon being laid before his Majesty, he
was struck off the list of Flag Officers. (Public Journals.)</p></div>

<p>April 25th.&mdash;Prince George kissed the King’s
hand on being created Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>26th.&mdash;Sir John Phillips moved the King’s Bench
for a Habeas Corpus for Murray, which was granted.
Sir John was a man of a worse character than parts,
though they were not shining. He had quitted Parliament
on the desperate situation of the Jacobite cause,
after having attempted during the last Rebellion to
get the Subscriptions and Associations for the King
declared illegal; and was now retired to Oxford, the
sanctuary of disaffection.</p>

<p>The King sent a Message to both Houses to desire
they would pass an Act for appointing the Princess
Dowager of Wales, Regent, with proper limitations,
in case he died before the Prince was eighteen. The
Duke of Newcastle, seconded by the Duke of Devonshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
opened it in the House of Lords; Mr. Pelham,
and the Chancellor’s eldest son<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>, in the Commons.
Both the brothers made awkward and ill-placed panegyrics
on the Duke; and Addresses of Thanks were
voted.</p>

<p>27th.&mdash;Murray was brought by Habeas Corpus into
the King’s Bench; but, three Judges allowing the
validity of a commitment by the House of Commons,
he was remanded to Newgate.</p>

<p>May 1st.&mdash;The Regency Bill was to have been
brought into the House of Lords, but was deferred, to
be softened a little, upon objections made by the
Bishop of London to the unprecedented powers that
the Council had given themselves in it. The Chancellor
drew it; and for the honour of his profession
had contrived to show that a legal tyranny might be
formed as despotic as the most usurped authority.
And lest it should shock a free people, and draw an
odium on the Government, he had submitted to bear
the greatest share of the envy himself; for, though
the Bill was directed to establish the power of the
Pelhams, the Chancellor was likely to have the amplest
share by his own voice, and those of his creatures, the
Archbishop, the Chief Justice Lee, and my Lord
Anson, his son-in-law, whom they designed for first
Lord of the Admiralty, though on the original plan,
that Officer was omitted in the Council of Regency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
because they had not then determined to remove
Lord Sandwich.</p>

<p>3rd.&mdash;A question was proposed to the House by
Sir William Yonge, whether such members as were
named to be servants to the new Prince of Wales
were to vacate their seats, as their appointment was
by the King. Stone and John Selwyn were of the
number. It was agreed in the negative without a
Motion.</p>

<p>7th.&mdash;The Duke of Newcastle opened the Regency
Bill in the House of Lords, and it was read the first
time without opposition.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;The committee in the Lords on the Regency
Bill. Earl Stanhope, whose studies were mathematical,
and principles republican, to the honour of
which, though without any parts, he had acted
steadily in Opposition, when Jacobites and Royalist-Whigs,
and men of all other denominations had
changed for every other denomination, opposed the
clause that gave the Regent a Council; an opinion
that was rather more consistent with the effect of his
principles, to oppose a Regal Government, than with
his principles themselves; but it was carried by 98
against him, and the Earls of Thanet, Shaftesbury,
Oxford, and Lichfield, the Viscount Hereford and
Townshend, and the Lords Ward, Maynard, Foley,
Romney, and Talbot.</p>

<p>Lord Bath then made as miscellaneous a speech as
he used to do in the House of Commons; objecting to
the not leaving the Regent power to displace any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the inferior Commissioners of Treasury or Admiralty;
and weeping actual tears when he mentioned the
possible event of the King’s death. This duteous
dew was followed by a joke on Harry Vane<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>, formerly
his tool and spy, now in that office to the Pelhams,
and a wonderful Lord of the Treasury, who, whenever
he was drunk, told all he knew, and when he
was sober more than he knew, and whom Lord Bath
said, on seeing there, he did not mean to propose
removing. Then soaring up to a panegyric on the
Princess, he observed, that female reigns in England
had not been the least glorious, and yet the great
Princess, who was likely to figure with the Elizabeths
and the Annes, would not be empowered to reward
merit, or to place, if she found such an one, a proper
person at the head of the Treasury: that she even
would not have authority to appoint her own son,
Prince Edward, Lord High Admiral, nor to grant
convoys to any merchants who solicited for them:
that indeed she might tell the merchants she would
use her interest with Parliament to get this Bill
altered, and then she would protect them. He then
(it is very true he said so) wished that all employments
were for life, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quam diù</i> those who held them
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">se benè gesserint</i>; and professed (it is even true that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
he professed) having been ashamed of the struggles he
had seen for places, half of which he wished were to
be diminished at the King’s death, and the salaries to
be applied to the Sinking Fund: that, having been
lately in France, he had observed that the weight of
their debt is the debts on employments. He concluded
with declaring he liked the Bill, and did not
mean to oppose it.</p>

<p>Lord Bath<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> is so known a character, that it is
almost needless to draw him. Who does not know
that Mr. Pulteney was the great rival of Sir Robert
Walpole, whose power he so long opposed, at last
overturned, and was undone with it? Who does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
know that his virtue failed the moment his inveteracy
was gratified? Who does not know that all the
patriot’s private vices, which his party would not see
while he led them, were exposed, and, if possible,
magnified by them the instant he deserted them?
Who does not know that he had not judgment or resolution
enough to engross the power, which he had
forfeited his credit and character to obtain? and who
does not know that his ambition, treachery, irresolution,
timidity, and want of judgment were baffled<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and
made advantage of by a man who had all those vices
and deficiencies in a stronger proportion&mdash;for who
does not know the Duke of Newcastle?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>The Chancellor answered Lord Bath upon some
points of form that he had mentioned in the drawing
Commissions for the Boards of Treasury and Admiralty,
but owned that it was indifferent to him whether that
clause in the Bill were altered or not. Lord Bath
confessed himself in a mistake, having concluded that
a single alteration vacated the whole Commission. Dr.
Maddox, Bishop of Worcester, who did not want parts,
wanted them now, making a bad speech, and objected
that the Princess, who might make a Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland, would not have authority to make a Baron
of the Exchequer there; and he proposed her having
the disposal of all offices in general. The Duke of
Newcastle, who had too much good-nature, or too
much jealousy, to let anybody else be eminently ridiculous
where he was present, replied in a tone of
raillery, “that the nomination of Bishops and Judges
had been previously excepted, because the first thoughts
of the compilers of the Bill had been directed to the
security of our souls and properties, and had been
taken from the Regent, because she might not know
the true character of such Divines as were recommended
to her.” And, lest even this nonsense should
wear the appearance of an argument, his Grace added,
that he could not help remembering what had been
said when the Act of Union passed, that there were
already in the English House of Lords twenty-six
immortal Peers, meaning his good Lords the Bishops,
who he hoped would all deserve immortality.</p>

<p>Lord Talbot, a Lord of good parts, only that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
had rather more bias to “extravagance” than sense,
opposed the clause for continuing the Parliament for
three years after the King’s death; talked over the
nature of Government, asserted that the contests
arrived in England during minorities had not arisen
from new elections; and said, that “they might make
laws with relation to future Parliaments, but had no
power to extend the duration of the present.” Lord
Talbot<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> was a sworn enemy to the Chancellor from
some family jealousies, and soon after his father’s
death and Yorke’s elevation, who had made a speech
against some advantages that were demanded for the
Prince of Wales, Lord Talbot said, “He should certainly
submit to such high authority, if he had not in
his hand an opinion directly contrary, which he could
not help thinking of equal weight.” It was expected
that he was going to read a judgment of his father,
but it was an opinion which the present Chancellor himself
had given, when he was Attorney-General, on a
parallel case referred to his and Talbot’s judgment in
the late reign, when the present King had figured in
the character of a mutinous Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>Lord Granville replied to Lord Talbot, “That it
was the parliamentary clause that gave stability to
the whole Bill, and hoped we should even have enacted
it without a message from the Throne. That Rebellions
were best carried on during elections; that it had
been the policy of Louis the Fourteenth to foment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
them here at that season; and that he had had an
opportunity, when last Secretary of State, of knowing,
among the secrets which had not come to light, that
it had been an advice given in the Council of France
during the very last Rebellion, to wait for a general
election.” He declared his approbation of the restrictions,
not that they would, he hoped, be necessary in
the present case, but as they would be a precedent for,
and of service to posterity. The Bishop of London
made no opposition, and the Bill was committed by
106 to 12, Lord Townshend voting for the latter
clauses, and Lord Folkestone against them.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford was laid up with the gout and
rheumatism, but was very eager to have gone to the
House and opposed the whole tenour of the restrictions.
His friends apprehending that it would undo him with
the King (who had been made to believe that this act
against his own son was of his own direction), used
all their endeavours to dissuade him, and succeeded
pretty easily after the first division, which had been
composed of so few, and those such insignificant Lords.
Lord Sandwich, who was not impatient to precipitate
his own fall, voted, with the Duke’s consent, for every
part of the Bill.</p>

<p>13th.&mdash;The Lords read the Regency Bill the third
time, and sent it to the Commons, who read it immediately.
Mr. Pelham opened it, and moved for its
being read a second time. Sir Francis Dashwood
made several objections to it, and asked “What was
the intent of the Duke’s being the head of the Council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of Regency? a question, he said, simply of curiosity,
for he did not desire he should have any power. If
this Bill was calculated to pare away the prerogative,
he wished the Parliament would set about it roundly,
and stickle for a new Magna Charta. He observed
that there was no provision made, in case the Princess
should die before the determination of her Regency;
and he feared her being displeased with these very
strict limitations.” He attended the Bill no more,
which he foresaw would pass by a great majority,
after he had satisfied himself with declaring against it.
He was a man of sense without eloquence, and of
humour without good humour: naturally inclined to
adventures, and had early in his life made a voyage to
Russia, dressed like Charles the Twelfth, in hopes of
making the Czarina Anne fall in love with him&mdash;an
improper hero to copy, when a woman was to be
captivated! Oglethorpe found more faults in the
Bill; Nugent commended it extravagantly. Lord
Limerick too approved it, but observed a want of
provision, in case the King died during a dissolution
of Parliament, or before a new-elected one had sat.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General answered him, and the two
other opponents, and declared his opinion, that a new
chosen Parliament, even before a session, would
answer the purposes described in the Bill: but the
Solicitor-General thought that it must be the dissolved
Parliament that should re-assemble. The Attorney<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
was a man of singular goodness and integrity; of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
highest reputation in his profession, of the lowest in
the House, where he wearied the audience by the
multiplicity of his arguments; resembling the Physician
who ordered a medicine to be composed of all the
simples in a meadow, as there must be some of them
at least that would be proper. T. Pitt and Sydenham
spoke against the Bill; Dr. Lee in approbation of the
Council, as a safeguard to the Regent, and treated the
nomination to offices as a trifle. Henley spoke for the
Bill, but agreeing with Lord Limerick’s observation.
Mr. Pelham then proposed to read it a second time on
the morrow. T. Pitt asked for a longer day, and to
have the Bill printed, and was seconded by Sir John
Cotton; but on Mr. Pelham’s opposing it, there was no
division. The House sat till past seven.</p>

<p>14th.&mdash;The Regency Bill was read a second time,
and opposed only by Mr. Delaval, in a very absurd
speech, which he asked pardon for not having made
the day before, which was the first of his sitting in
Parliament.</p>

<p>16th.&mdash;The House went into the Committee on
the Regency Bill, when Mr. Pelham, who had apprehended
no considerable opposition, was in the Chair.
T. Pitt moved to refer the King’s Message to the
Committee; Vyner to adjourn till the Bill could be
printed; but as the House generally suffered him to
be singular in his opinion, nobody seconded him now.
Prowse, who affected to be in Opposition, what Mr.
Pelham affected to be in power, candid, and who was,
like Mr. Pelham, a man of some sense without parts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
said, “That when this Bill should be passed, he supposed
the King would not remove any of the great
Officers who were to compose the Regency, as they
would tacitly have had the approbation of Parliament;
indeed, of what must they be guilty to justify turning
them out after this approbation?” That it would be
quoted hereafter by ambitious subjects, who should
want to engraft themselves upon the Regal Authority,
that even this Parliament had strictly tied up the
hands of a Princess, whom they affected so much to
commend; that the Royal Power can’t be divided into
many hands; and that if this Bill passed, the nation
ought <em>indeed</em> to pray for the King’s life.</p>

<p>Lord Strange and Sir Roger Newdigate both spoke
against the Bill; and Charles Yorke, second son to the
Chancellor, a young lawyer of good parts, but precise
and affected, for it. He said, “That there were but
two instances of a Parliamentary Regency, those of
Richard the Second and Henry the Sixth, and in both
those, Councils had been established by Parliament;
that the confusions of those minorities flowed from
the advice of Parliament not being followed: that the
Duke of Gloucester, on his brother’s going to France,
applied to Parliament for directions how to act, and
was told by them, that his power was limited, and
accordingly had only the title of Protector conferred
on him: that this clause puts the Princess under a
happy inability of doing wrong; and that it would
quiet jealousies, if there be a subject among us who
could create suspicion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Fazakerley made remarks upon the Bill, without
directly opposing it; and then Mr. Onslow (the
Speaker) with a solemnity never more properly assumed,
made a noble and affecting speech against it.
“He professed that he would not have begun an opposition
to the Bill, but could not avoid, when once
it was opened, to declare that he thought the regulations
dangerous; and that having so much studied
the constitution, as it was his duty to do, he was
obliged to speak his opinion. It was, that the Regal
Power must not be divided; that control is dividing
it; that it never ought to be controlled, except when
abused; that instead of one King, we should have
nine; that the Council might put a negative on what
the Regent should propose; that to control, is to give
the power to those who control; that if the Council
refuse to make peace or war, the Regent must submit;
that this control is placed in the hands of those she
will not be able to control; that the best Regent we
ever had, the Earl of Pembroke, in Harry the Third’s
time, was a single Regent; a good man, but his virtue
was assisted by his undivided power. That he foresaw
there would be dissensions among themselves;
though he had a high opinion of those designed, yet
will they not be men? Power corrupts the best understandings;
factions in the Regency may derive
themselves into both Houses, and those who should correct,
may become parties in the grievance. In Edward
the Sixth’s time, though the reformation of
religion was then in question, did it check the animosities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
in the Council? Even then, letters-patent were
obtained in contradiction to an Act of Parliament,
which had limited the Protector’s authority. That
though any members of the future Council will be
removeable by address to Parliament, how will such
address be obtained against the most turbulent? Nay,
Parliament may be under a long prorogation, and the
Regent, all helpless, will see nothing but factions in
the Council that should assist her. How distressed will
be her condition, how distressed the condition of her
children, of the nation! I wish well,” continued he,
“to those who will have the power, a power that nobody
will envy them! Though it has the appearance
of establishing that power of which I am the most
apprehensive! I must&mdash;I will speak my duty! It
may be for the service of those who procure this Bill.
Why, if the power of peace and war is to be delegated,
why is it not entrusted to the Parliament? I hope
we are not to address the Council for either! Nay,
if we should submit to that humiliation, what, if they
should slight, as they may, our application? What a
solecism in this constitution to have Parliament contradicted
by nine persons!”</p>

<p>He then made a solemn prayer for the King’s life,
as the only preservative against this plan of power,
which, he said, if it ever took effect, would exceed all
the evils that could be foreseen from a single Regent.
For himself, he had nothing to ask, nothing to fear,
and whenever he should cease to serve the House, he
knew whither only he would go. He then entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
upon that monstrous clause, which subjects to the
penalties of a præmunire whoever shall attempt any
alteration of this system after it be enacted. He
argued with great weight on the prodigious danger of
it, and mentioned a test proposed in 1675 to oblige
members to take an oath not to attempt any alteration
in the State. It held a Debate of seventeen days,
and at last the House of Lords resolved, that such a
test would not affect Debates in Parliament, or restrain
them. He said, that if members should meet privately
to concert measures for the repeal of this law, it
might be construed into a præmunire; and many lives
had been taken away by construction. He concluded
with an earnest asseveration of the uprightness of his
intention, and a serious protest against the mischiefs
of the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham was inexpressibly shocked at this
speech, though he had no reason not to have apprehended
it. The Speaker had been at the private
meetings on the Bill, where he disputed warmly with
the Chancellor. Their cabal said that he acquiesced;
that when he had given his reasons and found they
had no weight, he had said no more&mdash;was that acquiescing?
They even said that he agreed to the
general plan on their softening some points, which at
last they did not soften. On sketching out some
correction of the most flagrant strokes of power, the
Duke of Newcastle had said, “Now they had reduced
the Bill to nothing!” The Speaker replied, “I wish
it was! it would be better for you. If it is nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
it is a reason for not doing it.” This argument
probably struck them, and so they did all they first
intended. He told Mr. Fox, that they might have
softened it with regard to the Duke, by declaring it
was the tenour of the English constitution. Mr. Fox
assured him, that the Duke had said, “My Lord
Chancellor told me, no such declaration could be
made, because circumstances might happen to make
it inconvenient. That crisis,” continued the Duke,
“must be when I am out of the question.”</p>

<p>The Speaker was master of an honesty, which
though it would bend very much upon most occasions,
especially when its warping would prop its reputation,
was tough and steady when pushed to an
extremity: and he would sometimes see that extremity
as soon in trifles as in materials. His disinterestedness<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
was remarkable, and he was fond of
exerting it. Popularity was his great aim, impartiality
his professed means, universal adulation and
partiality to whatever was popular, his real means of
acquiring it. He was bigoted to the power of the
House of Commons; and, like all zealots, ardent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
his own authority, as intimately connected with the
interests of his idol. He had much devotion from
the House, few friends in it, for he was too pompous
to be loved, though too ridiculous to be hated; had
too much knowledge not to be regarded; too much
dignity in his appearance not to be admired; and was
too fond of applause not to miss it.</p>

<p>The Speaker was answered in a long deduction by
the Attorney-General, and by Charles Yorke, who said,
that on the first Regency Bill after the Revolution, ten
Judges had given their opinions that the regal power
may be both delegated and divided. Lord Strange
asked shrewdly, “If it was probable that there
would be no dissensions in the Council of Regency,
which was to be composed of the present Ministry?
Survey them; with what cordiality have they concurred
in all measures for some years! May not it
happen, that if the Regent should refuse<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> to employ
some person recommended by them, the junto may
threaten to <em>resign?</em> an insult, such as within my
own time I have almost seen offered to a crowned
head! We shall see all that repeated scramble for
power, that I have two or three times seen acted
over. Can the Duke be removed by address of Parliament?
I won’t say that he is most likely to do
mischief, but certainly he is most capable of doing it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
As to the præmunire clause, the person who drew it
deserves to incur it.”</p>

<p>Murray, the Solicitor-General, said, “He did not
wonder there were but few precedents to direct them
of a Prince thinking thus greatly of his own death,
and providing for emergencies to arise after it: that
the Law of England knows no minority: if the person
of the minor King should be seized by force, his
power would accompany the possession of his person:
that this Bill creates a minority, and provides against
the evils of it: that in private cases, no guardian has
the whole power over an estate, that his ward will
have when he comes of age; that no Prince, even in
absolute governments, ever appointed a Regency
without control; that all the members of the future
Regency must be thought proper persons by the
King; that the great officers specified must be named
by him; and the four others whom he is to appoint
by his will must be entirely of his own choice; that
there are but three acts of legislation which the
Regent and the two Houses cannot perform&mdash;altering
the established succession, the established religion
in England, and the Presbyterian church government
in Scotland; that members of Parliament are not restrained
from taking measures to get this law repealed;
that the prohibition is levelled against altering what
shall be done by the Regency, not against altering
the Bill, and clause of præmunire. He asked whether
it was wished that the Regent should be made too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
powerful for the Council and both Houses of Parliament;
and whether even a King ever made a Judge
without the approbation of at least three of his Council?
and he added, that it would be a solecism to say that
the Council should be a check upon the Regent, and
yet be removeable by her as easily as she pleased.
That she would have a strong control upon them, as
they would not have power even to make a Judge
without her; nor be able to move anything without
her concurrence. With regard to what the Speaker
had urged on the delegation of the power of making
peace and war, he asked, if there was no difference
between entrusting it to a Council of seven hundred
men, who take all the inhabitants of this country to
their assistance, and a Council of twelve persons?”</p>

<p>Mr. Fox then declared himself for the Bill though
he spoke against almost every part of it; and being
afterwards told by Mr. Pelham peevishly, that
Pitt’s was the finest speech he ever heard, but that
he (Fox) had not spoke like himself; he replied,
“I know it; if I had, I should have said ten times
more against the Bill;” but he objected that the præmunire
clause was a little ambiguously worded, and
that if the person who penned it was aware how
wrong it was, he indeed deserved to incur all the
weight of it. “Can fourteen persons<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
“have power, and not want more than their share?
and if the Regent and her Council should proclaim
the young King major a year before the time specified,
would not a man in the street who hallooed at
such proclamation be liable to a præmunire?” “The
crime,” he added, “was too uncertainly described
for such heavy punishment, and of all times a minority
is the worst to subject the people to penal laws.”
He would have had the whole clause omitted, because
every man, without being a lawyer, ought to know
what the Regent can or cannot do. He asserted, that
as the Chancellor is named in the Bill to be necessarily
of the Regency, the putting the Great Seal in
Commission would violate the Act. If they would
not erase the whole clause, he proposed that the
punishment annexed should be impeachment, as it
could only be meant to come at great persons who
should attempt to disturb the Settlement. Mr. Pelham,
from the chair, told him angrily that this was
not the clause then in debate, but the first clause,
which passed without a division about seven o’clock.</p>

<p>Norris Bertie then spoke against the whole Bill,
thinking penal laws dangerous in the hands of ten
subjects equal to himself, and that he was serving
his country while he delayed the Bill even by speaking.
Sir John Barnard declared against appointing
a Council, and affirmed that the consideration of
the person intended for Regent ought to have weight
in the Debate, though the contrary was asserted;
that while she was controlled, we should have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
kingly authority; the more preposterous, as he could
foresee no inconveniences from the Princess’s enjoying
it; that the nation might want some of its great
officers, unless she should always name such persons
as should be agreeable to the junto, who would have
means of inducing the Parliament to pass Acts disagreeable
to her, at the same time, that without them
she would not have power to dissolve or prorogue it.
He concluded with desiring it should be known that
he was utterly against the Council. Harding, a
sensible knowing man, but who having been many
years clerk to the House, was not well received as a
speaker, said, “that the mischiefs of former Regencies
arose from a neglect of proper restrictions; and he
quoted Chancellor Oxenstiern, who, on the death of
Gustavus Adolphus, had given his advice to the
senate of Sweden to compose a mixed Regency, but
not to appoint a sole Regent, or a Council of Regency
without a Regent. He added, that in his opinion
even the Duke might be removed from the Council.”
This frank delivery of his sentiments was the more
honest, as he was actually the Duke’s Attorney.</p>

<p>Nugent made a bombast speech about an angel;
and then Lord Cobham (the only one of the cousin-hood
who could not be turned out, having no place;
Lyttelton and George Grenville had both without
doors, like him) declared against the Council. He
said, “He could not figure a weaker government than
what they were chalking out; and as if there were
not factions enough in the legislative power, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
were laying a foundation for as many in the executive,
and were destroying a Bill, which, if the
Council clause were omitted, would be the most
popular that ever was passed; that he had come to
the House resolving to acquiesce even in this, as he
thought it would be happy if it were universally
assented to; but when others had made objections,
he could not suppress his, which was to the Council,
not to the continuance of the Parliament; that the
House of Commons might perhaps address the Regent to
remove some of the Council, while the House of Lords
might vote an approbation of the same persons; at
the same time that the Parliament could not be dissolved
but by an irremovable Council, the usual way
of putting a stop to differences between the two
Houses. He then turned absurdly to an apology for
himself, as people do who are fearful or conscious, and
hoped his behaviour was free from reproach; that he
did not like cutting the Government out into sippets;
but desired to be understood to have a good opinion
of some, of many that were to compose the Council;
and hoped that those (he approved) would never be
removed from her Royal Highness’s ear; at the same
time he believed that those who brought in the Bill
did not foresee all the power of the Council; nor
would he himself consent to the prolongation of the
Parliament, if he thought it was calculated for bad
purposes.”</p>

<p>Lord Cobham<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> was the absolute creature of Pitt;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
vehement in whatever faction he was engaged, and
as mischievous as his understanding would let him
be, which is not saying he was very bad. He had
kept less measures with Mr. Pelham than any of his
connexion, and had not spoke to him above once for
the last six months. He was more a gentleman than
his brother George<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>, who was a pedant in politics,
but less deceitful. James<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>, the youngest of the three,
had all the defects of his brothers, and had turned
them to the best account. All of them were troubled
with a redundancy of words peculiar to their family,
though without the energy of Pitt’s language, or the
hyperbole of Lyttelton’s.</p>

<p>Martin spoke for the clause, and said, “the King
could not have a separate interest from his people,
the Princess might; witness Queen Isabella and her<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
minion Mortimer: that if this precedent were established,
it could not hereafter be set aside, if the young
King’s mother should happen to be a bad woman;
and that, if the conduct of the Princess were a foundation
for entrusting her with the sole power, it was so
amiable and estimable, that the argument would go
to giving her absolute power.” Sir John Cotton disapproved
of the latitude given to the King, of naming
four persons to be of the Council by a testamentary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>disposition, and of whom the House could know nothing.
Pitt declared he had no objection to the
Council, as he could find no traces of a Regent without
control; and then (as if all mankind had forgot
his ingratitude to the Prince, as he had his obligations
to him) he pronounced the present case doubly aggravated
by the loss of the most <em>patriot</em> Prince that
ever lived, to whom he had such infinite obligations,
and such early attachments, which he was proud to
transfer to his family. Then turning to the King,
whom he regarded with wonder for exerting a fortitude
which Edward the Third had not been master of,
he blessed the Crown when it was the first to lessen
the royal authority, as it had been in the present
case, by pointing out these limitations, so expedient,
as dangers were to be foreseen from abroad&mdash;from at
home, if we considered the great person who might
have become sole Regent. What a precedent would
that have been for futurity, if hereafter any ambitious
person should think less of protecting the Crown than
of wearing it! With regard to the Princess, the
limitations were of no consequence, for let her but
hint to Parliament at any improper negative given
by the Council to her recommendation, an address
would immediately be offered to her to remove them.
He desired, if that event should ever happen, to be
put in mind of what he now said, and he would
second the Motion.</p>

<p>Fox replied, “that it was an absurd notion not to
give the Princess the whole power of royalty, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
she was not called Queen; and he hoped that the
nation was not only safe from the characters of
the persons who were to compose the Council,
but from the constitution; and if that, and the
laws already in force, were not sufficient to circumscribe
the Regent, our liberties would not be
safe; that if those laws would not be efficient under
a Regent, how are they so under a King? That as
to the precedents that had been alleged, they were
urged ridiculously; must this be assented to because
it was so in the days of Harry the Third, when the
constitution was totally unlike what it is now? Half
of the Regency nominated by Henry the Eighth were
Papists, half Protestants; was that disposition preferable
to a single Regent? No; it was formed for
dissension; nor is there one reason to be drawn from
precedent, or from the nature of our constitution.
Should we follow the example of the Barons? The
only reason to imitate them would be, that the times
are unlike. Oxenstiern’s advice too is totally unapplicable:
not,” continued he, “that I believe the
Council will obstruct the Regent’s measures; I believe
they will assist her: but if they should not,
whoever should advise her to make a speech to Parliament
to accuse her Ministers, would be guilty of a
præmunire.” Pitt answered, “That the tendency of
such a speech would not be to alter the plan of
Regency, but to check a faction; that what he had
said regarded the clause of non-amotion; and that he
was of Mr. Fox’s opinion, who must have mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
all his speech, or he all Fox’s, though the latter had
said that he would not be included as agreeing for
his reasons. That in any case he should not be for
lodging power where there may be a temptation to
prolong it.” Fox replied again, “That a Regent
could not be more dangerous than a King; and
imagined that Pitt had meant that the Regent’s
speech should be intended to prevail on the Parliament
to address her to alter the whole tenour of the
Bill.” The House grew tired of their altercations, and
more of General Oglethorpe, who spoke after them;
and divided between nine and ten at night, when the
Council clause was voted by 278 to 90; and then
they adjourned the further consideration of the Bill
till next day.</p>

<p>17th.&mdash;The Committee on the Regency Bill was
resumed. Lord Strange asked, if being nominated to
the Council of Regency would vacate a seat in Parliament.
T. Pitt proposed to leave out such words as
precluded the Princess from disposing of offices. Old
Horace Walpole ridiculed the Speaker, and was glad
that with all his pomp and protestations he had no
more influence. He was proceeding to preach up more
regard to the King’s Message, but was called to order
by T. Pitt and Lord Strange, who objected to making
such use of the King’s name in a Debate. Prowse
said, “he would appeal to that great treaty-maker,
whether it was proper that fourteen persons should be
entrusted with all the steps of a negotiation? That
for the nomination of Bishops and Judges, he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
it a trifle; but disapproved extremely of the Council
having any power to dispose of the Treasury, which
with so great an army of revenue-men might be
dangerous, if in the opposite scale to the Crown.”
Horace Walpole replied, “That some had carried it
so much beyond him, as to be willing to trust the
secret of treaties to seven hundred persons.”</p>

<p>Horace Walpole<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> was still one of the busiest men in
Parliament; generally bustling for the Ministry to
get a Peerage, and even zealous for them when he could
not get so much as their thanks. With the King
he had long been in disgrace, on disputing a point of
German genealogy with him (in which his Majesty’s
chief strength lay) whose the succession of some Principality
would be, if eleven or twelve persons then
living should die without issue. He knew something
of everything but how to hold his tongue, or how to
apply his knowledge. As interest was in all his
actions, treaties were in all his speeches. Whatever
the subject was, he never lost sight of the peace of
Utrecht, Lord Bolingbroke, and the Norwich manufactures;
but his language and oratory were only adapted
to manufacturers. He was a dead weight on his brother’s
Ministry; the first to take off that load on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
brother’s fall;<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> yet nobody so intemperately abusive on
all who connected with his brother’s enemies; nobody
so ready to connect with them for the least flattery,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
which he loved next to money&mdash;indeed he never
entirely forgave Lord Bath for being richer. His
mind was a strange mixture of sense alloyed by absurdity,
wit by mimicry, knowledge by buffoonery,
bravery by meanness, honesty by selfishness, impertinence
by nothing. <span class="nowrap">* * * *</span></p>

<p>Sydenham, as an old Tory, spoke for the undiminished
prerogative, quoted Greek, and said that
subjects had never before attempted to make Peers;
and that the commissions of Judges determine at the
King’s death. Robinson urged that the House can
only be adjourned by itself; but Sir William Yonge
gave him precedents to the contrary; particularly,
that the two first sessions of the late King’s first Parliament
had been adjourned by the Crown; and that
nobody is at liberty to speak after the Crown has sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>a Message for adjournment. Sir John Cotton asked,
if the Crown had the power of adjournment, seeing
the method is to send to desire the House would
adjourn itself? T. Pitt (who the last summer had
held a tin Parliament in Cornwall, had been baffled
by an opposition erected by the Boscawens, under the
auspices of the Ministry) was obliged from his own
case to argue for the prerogative, and said, “That
during his holding that Parliament he had searched for
precedents, and had found that the Crown could adjourn
even by proclamation, or by a message from the Secretary
of State.” Robinson acquiesced, but observed,
“That there is no possibility of suspending the power
of the legislature; that if the Regent can repeal this
Act, she may repeal the three that by this she is excepted
from the power of repealing.” The Solicitor-General
answered, “That it is only a direction to her
not to give her consent to the repeal of the three Acts,
though, if she should, it would be valid.”</p>

<p>The clause for continuing the sitting Parliament to
the end of the minority, was then read. Lord
Limerick, with as much zeal as if he too had lately
held a tin Parliament, made a panegyric on the two
Georges, and on the blessings which the people had enjoyed
under them without tasting them;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and hoped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the nation would be in such profound tranquillity
as not to need the prolongation of the Parliament;
and that the Ministers then will not act by half measures,
and by expedients from day to day; and in
confidence that they will dissolve the Parliament as
soon as they may with safety, he made a motion of
amendment to the clause, that it may be the last dissolved
Parliament that shall assemble on the King’s
death, if another, though chosen, shall not have met
and sat. Lord Strange approved the Motion, except
that he liked just the reverse of it; and would have
established the newly elected Parliament. Dr. Lee
answered, “That the act of Queen Anne on a parallel
case, prefers the old Parliament:” and Gybbon
assigned the reason, because there may arise Debates
on the new Speaker and double returns.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox asked, “If the prolonged Parliament is
not to dissolve of course as soon as the minor King
comes of age?” The Attorney-General replied, “The
general law of the land will then operate for its dissolution.”
But Henley said, “That, as the new elect
might be composed of ignorant persons, he wished the
prolonged Parliament were to last six months after
the commencement of the majority, that the young
King might have the same benefit from that act that
an older Prince would have!” Sir William Yonge
approved this opinion, and said, he remembered that
on the late King’s accession, instead of attending the
business of the House, every body ran out of town
to secure their re-elections. The Solicitor-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
replied, “That as the prolonging Parliaments was
neither an eligible nor popular measure, he was glad
the regulation extended no further; though it was
more necessary now to continue their duration for
some time after a King’s death than when Parliaments
did not give the Revenue.” George Townshend spoke
against the Parliament’s prolonging itself, and said,
“There was nothing so dangerous as to inculcate into
a young King, that he owes his safety to anything
unconstitutional.”</p>

<p>Fazakerley made a tedious calculation, which he
seemed to intend for humour, of how long the Parliament
might possibly continue if every one of the late
Prince of Wales’s children should happen to die just
at a given time. The Solicitor replied, “That, if
such melancholy accidents should happen, the reasons
for the continuation would increase in proportion.”
Morton spoke for, Dowdswell and Sir John Cotton
against the amendment; but it was voted. Lord Harley<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
then spoke prettily against the whole clause, and said,
“That all the arguments that had been used would
hold good upon all elections, and would tend to make
any Parliament perpetual; and that such groundless
apprehensions ought not to be appeased at the expense
of the constitution; that the people will be cheated
who will not have opportunities of changing such representatives
as they dislike; and that upon the
whole he observed, that Parliaments had originally
been annual, then were stretched to triennial, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
lengthened out to septennial, and now were going to
be made perpetual.”</p>

<p>Lord Hilsborough said, “That the arguments urged
against the clause were reducible to those of power,
right, and expedience. That the Parliament has power
to prolong itself, is plain from the very debating upon
it; that it has a right, appears from the Triennial and
Septennial Acts, and from the Sixth of Queen Anne;
and for the expedience, it is a known maxim, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">salus
populi suprema lex esto</i>. That in the case of a Rebellion,
would a Parliament allow of its own dissolution,
which would bring on the tumults of new
elections? or in case of a plague, would any wise
Government give occasion to great and populous assemblies,
when it would even be unfit for the Parliament
itself to meet? That the event in question
might include all the others, and probably would some
of them; and that the prolongation now in Debate
would not be actual, but discretionary, while the
circumstance of the manner in which it came recommended
must strike the breast of every man.” Bowes,
Vyner, and T. Pitt, spoke against the clause; Charles
Yorke for it. Sir John Rushout observed that T. Pitt
had made the King’s Message the foundation of the
Debate, and then had objected to its being pleaded. He
was called to order, and so were some others; Gray
and Dowdswell then spoke against, and Southwell for
the clause, which was carried at half an hour after
seven, by 258 to 81.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Then was read the clause to prevent the young
King from marrying before the expiration of his minority,
unless with consent of the Regent, and the major
part of the Council; and to annul any such marriage,
and to declare all the persons concerned guilty of
high treason. This clause, which on the very face of it
is a flat contradiction to the established opinion of the
Church of England, which never heard of dissolution
of marriage for political reasons, had passed uncontroverted
through the House of Lords, undisputed by
the Bench of Bishops. So obsequiously now did the
sages of the Ecclesiastic Courts bow to temporal
power! Fazakerley alone in the Commons remonstrated
against it, and showed “the dangers that may
arise from pronouncing the King’s wife guilty of high
treason, and her children illegitimate; and the mischiefs
it may occasion, as he may marry her again
after his majority&mdash;unless you will divest the Crown
of the prerogative of pardon, and that in the dearest
case, and will bind the Regency not only to prosecute
a new species of treason, but to enforce the penalty.
If this illegal Queen may be pardoned, and then
espoused again, what confusions, what contests may
not spring from the different children she may bear
during her first and second marriage, when one son
may plead his birthright under the new establishment,
the other his seniority under all the known descriptions
of legitimacy in the Church of England.”</p>

<p>The Attorney-General made a slight answer, and
this new kind of divorce passed without farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
opposition.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Schisms and holy wars have sprung from
smaller seeds! But religious animosities were out
of date; the public had no turn for controversy;
the Church had no writers to make them fond of
it again. This had lately appeared; Dr. Middleton,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>the best writer of the age, had overturned the Fathers,
and exploded some visions of the Bishop of London,
without a tolerable answer being made in defence of
either. Of the prelates, the Archbishop<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> was a harmless
good man, inclined to much moderation, and of
little zeal for the tinsel of religion. Hutton, the other
Archbishop, was well bred and devoted to the Ministry.
Honest old Hoadley,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> who, to the honour of
his times, had, though the champion of Liberty, risen
to the rich Bishopric of Winchester, was in a manner
superannuated. Sherlock of London, almost as able a
combatant for the power and doctrines of the Church,
was past his strength, and still fonder of the politics
of the Government than of the honour of the Keys.
The Bishop of Durham<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> had been wafted to that See
in a cloud of metaphysics, and remained absorbed
in it. Gooch of Ely, the highest Churchman in his
heart, had risen to his present greatness in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>Church by shifting his politics. The rest were men
neither of note nor temper to give the Ministry any
disturbance.</p>

<p>Then the præmunire clause was read. Mr. Fox
said, “He was ready either to wait for the opinions
of the lawyers, or to endeavour to amend the clause
himself. That he had several objections to the wording
of it; that <em>Acts passed</em> may be Acts of Parliament;
that <em>in order to vary the Settlement</em> ought
never to be words in a penal Act; by the same rule
a person would be guilty of robbery who went to a
gunsmith’s with another to buy pistols <em>in order</em> to
rob. That <em>null and void</em> must mean Acts of Parliament,
not letters-patent, for they cannot supersede
Acts of Parliament. That the crimes intended to be
punished by this law should be certainly known,
and not subject to constructions. That the door of
the house where the plague was would be marked,
and then whoever entered, let him die!” He then
proposed to leave out the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">præmunire</i>, and to
leave the pursuit of the crime to the common course
of the law of the land; or to make it even high-treason,
provided it was made clear to the subjects,
what the crime was to be; as no man can suffer but
for known crimes. That the maxim, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Misera est servitus
ubi lex est inserta</i>, can only be meant of penal
laws, for all other laws are undoubtedly much too uncertain.
Fox frequently attacked the lawyers; he
loved disputing as much as they do, but as he loved
sense and argument, which they make a trade of perplexing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
he could not bear a society who at once inverted
the use of reason and the profession of justice.</p>

<p>He was answered by Murray, the Solicitor-General,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
a frequent antagonist of his, who had quickness and
eloquence enough to defend or not to want the knowledge
of the Law, of which he was master. He said,
“There could be no hurt in omitting the words that conveyed
any doubtful meaning; that the Bill was calculated
against unlawful acts, such as force and usurpation,
upon the foundation of former examples, particularly
the disposition made by Henry the Eighth; that it
was only a clause <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in terrorem</i>; that there must be an
overt act; that the House had already passed a sanction
of the same nature in the marriage clause: but
if these words were disliked, you might insert <em>unlawfully
and without consent of Parliament</em>; and that
the Regent would certainly not be included within the
words.”</p>

<p>Fox accepted the proposed words, but would have
omitted <em>in order</em>, which would still leave the necessity
of the overt act in full force. He insisted “that the
clause affects nobody but those who assist the Regent
in endeavouring the repeal of this Act, and consequently
that she is tied up from innovating, while her
Council are at liberty to attempt what farther usurpations
they please upon hers and the royal authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
It is difficult to ascertain what her accomplices must
or must not will and know, to include them within
the penalty; that if she takes out letters-patent to be
sole Regent, are the clerks who draw them to be
subject to the præmunire? That it must be right to
omit the words <em>in order</em>, since in the Solicitor’s
opinion they were useless; in his, dangerous: but
supposing they were still to remain, he could not help
insisting on being told, what punishment there would
be for him or any man who should attempt to cancel
the Regency Bill without the connivance of the
Regent?” The Solicitor replied, “That such act
would be against the King, because he was in her
hands; but that this provides against doing it <em>with</em>
her consent. That the words <em>in order</em> were neither
so unheard of, nor so formidable as was pretended;
that the Coventry Act has the equivalent words <em>with
intent</em>; and that the Mutiny Bill (brought in by Mr.
Fox) has even the words <em>in order</em>. He owned that
those words were inserted to prevent the connivance
of the Regent from giving an air of legality to any
attempts of innovation.” The Master of the Rolls
said, “He could not point out words to describe the
crime, but he thought <em>with intent</em> preferable to <em>in
order</em>.”</p>

<p>Fox asked, “If whether, as it was allowed that it
would be lawful to attempt the repeal of the Act by
parliamentary methods, the attempters would be
guilty of a præmunire, if the Parliament should not
concur for the repeal? But that as it was confessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
by great lawyers that the crime could not be described,
he desired to have it considered, whether it would not
be more proper, more humane, and more sensible, to
leave the punishment to the Judges?” Sir Richard Loyd
said “That the words <em>in order</em> were not dangerous,
but that <em>advising</em> was too vague, as it may be proper
to give the Regent such advice; that if the word <em>promoting</em>
stood, he should wish to insert <em>unless to apply
to Parliament</em>.” Fazakerley approved the addition of
<em>without the consent of Parliament</em>. The Attorney
said, “That <em>intent</em> could only relate to the person,
not to the concurrence; that he thought the words
<em>Acts passed</em> might be omitted, but that the lowest
persons concurring knowingly to defeat the Act, ought
to incur equal punishment.” Lord Strange said, “It
must mean Acts of Parliament, for nothing else could
set aside this:” and then he moved the amendments
that had been proposed.</p>

<p>Pitt said, “He imagined they were already agreed
to; that he would have <em>Acts passed</em> omitted, but
liked <em>in order</em>: that he approved the addition of the
word <em>unlawful</em>, but would omit <em>without consent of
Parliament</em>, because it would be inviting applications
to Parliament, and would make men turn their minds
to get this Act repealed, though there was no doubt
already, but that the Parliament could alter this
settlement if it should please.” He then moved to
leave out <em>Acts</em>, and was seconded by Fox. Fazakerley
asked whether it would not be necessary to have a
Commission of Regency if the Princess should be ill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Pitt then moved to insert <em>unlawfully</em>, and Fox yielded
not to mention <em>without consent of Parliament</em>, and
to let <em>in order</em> stand. Lord Strange said, if he were
to have the Princess’s ear, he would advise her to get
this Act repealed. Fox moved for leaving out <em>concurring</em>.
Old Horace Walpole argued for its remaining;
and Sir William Yonge defended it as
meaning no more than the three other words that
accompanied it. Fox ridiculed him on his reverence
for the sacredness of tautology, and said, that if all
those words had the same meaning, he would leave out
three of them. Pitt was for retaining the word, because
it had once been inserted, and to omit it now,
would be telling the people that they might concur.
Thus at half-an-hour after ten at night, this inquisition
clause, having dwindled into a grammatical dispute,
was voted, with corrections more <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'worthy grammarians'">worthy of grammarians</ins>
than a House of Commons, by 126 to 40; a few of
Mr. Fox’s and the Duke of Bedford’s friends insisting
upon a division, though the former would himself have
acquiesced.</p>

<p>20th&mdash;The Bill was reported, read a third time,
and passed, with nothing material but a long bad
speech of Mr. Beckford against it, and Mr. Pelham’s,
who was now got free from the chair, for it. He said,
“He would not observe on what any particular person
had said, but must express his surprise at so much
Debate, after the message had been sent by the King,
who had recommended restrictions, which had been
approved by both Houses, and his Majesty had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Addresses of Thanks from both upon it.” He said, that
notwithstanding this, the Debates had not been upon
any particular restrictions, but against any at all;
yet he must ask, how appointing a Council for the
Regent was a breach of the constitution? That as to
precedents, for his part he had never heard one
exactly stated and followed in observations; that in
the present case, what was to be learnt from precedents,
was, the danger of minorities; and that the
remedy now to be applied, was not a breach, but a
preservative of the constitution, against it could
operate again. That his motive for approving the
Council, was, that he would not lead the Princess into
temptation; that he was willing to give her all the
agreeable part of authority; and that the Council
would be no check, where she was to exert grace and
favour, but only where there should be weighty points
that might introduce difficulties. That it was possible
she might get favourites about her; that a Regent
may be subject to them as well as a King; that it was
for her security to have a Council responsible. That
when the settlement of the Crown was made in favour
of the House of Hanover, greater restrictions than
those in question had been proposed, and somewhat
stronger than temporary Regencies. That the Regent
would only be limited in those great acts, where the
Crown itself is limited, of peace and war.</p>

<p>Is there, continued he, any person here wise enough
to tell me, who is answerable for the acts of the
Regent? She herself is; and as this provision takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
off that subjection from her, it is a respect to her. I
hope I shall not be thought to want respect to her, if
I, who have ventured to speak my mind under the
King my master, am as freely spoken in what regards
the Princess. He then mentioned the clause for prolonging
the Parliament, and said, that ever since the
Restoration, there has always been a dissolution or
suspension of Government during general elections;
that a contagion has constantly arisen, which has
suspended all connexions of friendship, all notions of
right and wrong; and that many a man has given his
vote for one man, who would leave the care of his
children to that very man’s antagonist. That our
constitution gives sanctions to invasions, to that bad
spirit of disaffection, which makes our enemies lie in
wait till they see how elections turn out. He added,
that he should say very little upon the clause of præmunire,
which had been so fully explained and
answered by the lawyers; though it was sufficient that
Englishmen wanted no farther safety, who must be
tried by juries, that are not likely to stretch constructions.
One thing he would say, <em>that the Bill
cannot be too strictly observed</em>. For the objections,
they were not against the whole Bill; and the Committee
had acquiesced in amending those parts that
were most liable to exception. That indeed he could
not but lament that the approbation of the House had
not been more general, as he knew, when differences
arise there, what constructions are made upon them
without doors: but that he only lamented this, did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
pretend to blame, as he spoke without prejudice,
passion, or partiality, and that he was persuaded
nobody would suspect him of any prospect to power
for himself from this Bill, as he should be too great a
wretch to build views of grandeur on what he must
regard as the greatest misfortune, and what would
shake the foundations of his country. It is observable,
that of the two persons who had framed, and
were to glut their own ambition the most by this Bill,
the Chancellor and Mr. Pelham, the former pronounced
any man a fool, the latter stamped him a
villain, who expected or laid a plan of power from it.
It passed without a division. The greater part of the
late Prince’s Court voted for the Bill. Lord Egmont
for nothing but prolonging the Parliament.</p>

<p>21st.&mdash;The amendments were explained to the
Lords by the Duke of Newcastle and the Chancellor,
and agreed to.</p>

Robert Walpole to apply himself to politics, in which, soon
making a figure, he was appointed Secretary at War, when the
Whigs came into power in the late King’s reign; but towards
the end of it he went into Opposition, at the head of which he
continued till the fall of Sir Robert Walpole. That Minister
persuaded the King, when he took leave of him, to comply with
none of Mr. Pulteney’s demands, unless he would quit the
House of Commons and accept a Peerage, which he imprudently
promising to do, though not without great reluctance, before the
patent was passed, and raising his creatures,&mdash;Sandys, Sir John
Rushout, Gybbon, Harry Vane, and Harry Furnese,&mdash;who were
men of the meanest capacities, to the chief places, in preference
to all the rest of the Opposition who had acted with him, they
refused to follow him in his politics, and persecuted him in Parliament,
and with innumerable libels and satires. On the death
of Lord Wilmington, he asked for the Treasury, to which
Mr. Pelham was preferred, but to which he was named in the
Ministry of three days. From that time he made no figure;
he was immensely rich, from great parsimony and great successions,
and had endeavoured to add another to them: the
Duchess of Buckingham, natural daughter to King James II.,
designing to take a journey to Rome, to promote some Jacobite
measures, and apprehending the consequence, made over her
estate to Lord Bath, by a deed which he afterwards sunk, and
pretended to have lost. On this, the Duchess, after forcing a
release from him, struck him out of her will as one of her
Executors; and many years afterwards, on marrying her grandson
to Lord Hervey’s daughter, she appointed Sir Robert Walpole
one of her Executors. This happening soon after that
Minister’s fall, he said to Lord Oxford in the House of Lords,
“So, my Lord, I find I have got my Lord Bath’s place before
he has got mine.”</p></div>

the Bishops appeared in May, 1753. Lord Bath had brought
in a Bill to prevent clandestine marriages, which being very exceptionable,
a new one was ordered to be brought in by the
Judges, and was accordingly drawn up and warmly patronized
by the Chancellor, and as warmly, though ineffectually, opposed
by the Duke of Bedford; the whole Episcopal Bench consenting
to the Act, though there were several clauses which enjoined dissolution
of marriage for temporal reasons. In the House of
Commons it was opposed by Fox and Nugent; on the other hand,
the Attorney-General, who had been bred a Presbyterian, supported
it, and applauded the conduct of the Bishops, <em>who</em>, he said,
<em>had at last reduced Christianity to common sense</em>. This sentence
occasioning great astonishment, he softened it by adding, that
he only meant that the Bishops had at last consented to remove
a superstructure, raised on the foundation of the Gospel, which
Christ and the Apostles had never projected, it being only intended
by the New Testament that marriages contracted under
the laws of the country should be indissoluble; and that it was
nowhere said that even the intervention of a priest was essential
to the validity of matrimony.</p></div>

<p>The day after the Committee in the House of Commons,
the King said aloud in the drawing-room at
Kensington, that the amendments to the præmunire
clause were rightly made. The Chancellor answered,
“the insertion of the word <em>unlawfully</em> was unnecessary.”
“That,” replied the King, “is a distinction
only for lawyers to make.” Mr. Pelham would have
explained it to him in a low voice, but he would talk
upon it publicly.</p>

<p>About the same time, the King talking to Mr. Fox
in his closet upon the Bill, asked him, whom he would
have made Regent? “Sir,” said Mr. Fox, “I never
thought I should be asked, and therefore never thought&mdash;if
it was impossible the Duke should!” The King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
replied, “My affection was there;” but avoided talking
on the impossibility. He assumed to himself the chief
direction of the Bill, and added, “I have a good
opinion of the Princess, but I don’t quite know her.”
He then spoke largely and sensibly on the restrictions,
and gave reasons for them. “That a Council was
necessary for her, even in cases of treason: women are
apt to pardon; I myself am always inclined to mercy;
it is better to have somebody to refuse for her. As
to the power of peace and war, I never would declare
either without consulting others. And as to the objection
of the Council being irremoveable, who knows
it will be composed of the present people? It will be
the Ministers I shall leave: had you rather have those
I shall leave, or have the Princess at liberty to go and
put in Lord Cobham or Lord Egmont? What did
you say against the Bill?&mdash;do you like it? tell me
honestly.” Fox answered, “If you ask me, sir&mdash;no.
What I said against it was, because what was said for
it was against the Duke.” The King told him, “I
thank you for that: my affection is with my son: I
assure you, Mr. Fox, I like you the better for wishing
well to him. The English nation is so changeable! I
don’t know why they dislike him. It is brought
about by the Scotch, the Jacobites, and the English
that don’t love discipline; and by all this not being
enough discouraged by the Ministry.”</p>

<p>To complete the history of this memorable Bill, I
shall subjoin some account of its author.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Yorke, Baron of Hardwick, and Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Chancellor, was <span class="nowrap">* * * *</span> the son of an attorney at
Dover. He was a creature of the Duke of Newcastle,
and by him introduced to Sir Robert Walpole, who
contributed to his grandeur and baseness, in giving
him an opportunity of displaying the extent of the
latter, by raising him to the height of the former.
He had good parts, which he laid out so entirely upon
the Law in the first part of his life, that they were of
little use to him afterwards, when he would have applied
them to more general views. He was Attorney-General,
and when the Solicitor Talbot was, after a
contest, preferred to him for the Chancellorship (the
contest lay between their precedence, for Talbot was as
able a man, and an honest one), Sir Robert Walpole
made Yorke Chief-Justice for life, and greatly encreased
the salary. Talbot dying in a short time
after his advancement, to the great grief of all good
men, Yorke<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> succeeded. In his Chief-Justiceship he
had gained the reputation of humanity, by some
solemn speeches made on the Circuit, at the condemnation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of wretches for low crimes; a character he lost
with some when he sat as Lord High Steward at the
trials of the Scotch Lords, the meanness of his birth
breaking out in insolent acrimony. On his promotion,
he flung himself into politics; but as he had no
knowledge of foreign affairs, but what were whispered
to him by Newcastle, he made a very poor
figure.</p>

<p>In the House of Lords, he was laughed at; in the
Cabinet, despised.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> On the Queen’s death, he went
deep into the Duke’s shallow scheme of governing the
King by the Princess Emily; for this cabal thought
that he must necessarily be ruled by a woman, because
the Queen was one, not considering it was because she
was a wise one. This scheme was to be built on the
ruin of Sir Robert Walpole, who had no other trouble to
make it miscarry than in making the King say “<em>Pho!</em>”
to the first advice this junto gave him. Their next
plot was deeper laid, and had more effect: by a confederacy
with the chiefs of the Opposition, they overturned
Sir Robert Walpole; and in a little time, the
few of their associates that they had admitted to share
the spoils. When Yorke had left none but his friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
in the Ministry, he was easily the most eminent for
abilities. His exceeding parsimony was qualified by
his severity to and discouragement of usurers and
gamesters; at least, he endeavoured to suppress that
species of avarice that exists by supplying and encouraging
extravagance. The best thing that can be
remembered of the Chancellor is his fidelity to his
patron; for let the Duke of Newcastle betray whom he
would, the Chancellor always stuck to him in his
perfidy, and was only not false to the falsest of
mankind.</p>

<p>The Pelhams having thus secured the duration of
their power by Act of Parliament, determined at least
to remove every object that gave any interruption or
uneasiness to their enjoyment of it. It will not easily
be understood how the Duke of Bedford and Lord
Sandwich, who were the present objects of offence,
could give them any uneasiness. The latter was
willing to submit to any indignities to keep his place;
and the former neither had, nor pretended to any
power, though Secretary of State. No measure,
foreign or domestic, but was transacted without his
participation. So far from having had any share in
the nomination of Officers and Governors to the young
Prince of Wales, the Duke of Bedford was not even
told he was to have any, nor acquainted when they
were actually appointed. He was not consulted upon
any one step of the Regency Bill; only when it was
entirely resolved, and had been actually communicated
to the Cabinet Council, at which Lord Sandwich, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
friend, was present, the Chancellor went to impart it
to him at his own house, where he was confined with
the gout. Indeed, at first he was pleased with this
farce of attention, till his friends pointed out the
insult of it. Notwithstanding all this submission,
the Duke of Newcastle had no peace till they were removed.
As he had no cause from <em>their</em> characters,
we must seek it in his own; and to show the force of
his jealousy, it will be necessary to give a deduction of
his several treacheries.</p>

<p>He succeeded young to an estate of about thirty
thousand pounds a year, and to great influence and
interest in several counties. This account in reality
contains his whole character as a Minister; for to the
weight of this fortune he solely owed his every-other-way
most unwarrantable elevation. His being heir to
his uncle, the old Duke of Newcastle, obtained from
the Crown a new creation of the title in his person;
and, though he was far from having parts to procure
him a Peerage, his Peerage and vast income procured
him the first posts in the Government. His person
was not naturally despicable; his incapacity, his mean
soul, and the general low opinion of him, grew to
make it appear ridiculous. A constant hurry in his
walk, a restlessness of place, a borrowed importance,
and real insignificance, gave him the perpetual air of
a solicitor, though he was perpetually solicited; for he
never conferred a favour till it was wrested from him,
but often omitted doing what he most wished done.
This disquiet and habit of never finishing, which, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
proceeded frequently from his beginning everything
twenty times over, gave rise to a famous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</i> of
Lord Wilmington,&mdash;a man as unapt to attempt saying
a good thing, as to say one. He said, “the Duke of
Newcastle always loses half an hour in the morning,
which he is running after the rest of the day without
being able to overtake it.”</p>

<p>He early distinguished himself for the House of
Hanover, and in the last years of Queen Anne retained
a great mob of people to halloo in that cause. He and
his brother Harry raised a troop for King George on
the Preston Rebellion, where the latter gave proofs of
personal courage. The Duke was rewarded with the
Garter, and some time after made Lord Chamberlain.
The late King chose him for the honour of being
Godfather to a new-born son of the Prince of Wales,
which his Royal Highness much disapproving, was the
immediate cause of that famous breach in the Royal
Family, when the Prince and Princess left the palace
very late at night. On Lord Carteret’s being sent
into honourable banishment as Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland, by the power of Lord Townshend and Sir
Robert Walpole, the latter proposed to make the Duke
of Newcastle Secretary of State, having experienced
how troublesome a man of parts was in that office.
The Viscount’s first wife having been the Duke’s
sister was another reason for their depending the more
on his attachment to them; but that very relation had
given Lord Townshend too many opportunities of discovering
how little he was to be trusted, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
from his having betrayed Lord Sunderland, his first
patron, to Lord Townshend, who earnestly objected to
the choice of him, and endeavoured to convince Sir
Robert Walpole how much his falsehood would give an
edge to his incapacity. As the disagreement increased
between those two Ministers, the Duke in every
instance betrayed his brother-in-law to Sir Robert.
The Viscount was not of Walpole’s forgiving temper,
and was immediately for discarding the Duke. He
pressed both King and Queen to it; exclaimed against
his childishness and weakness, and insisted upon his
dismission as the only terms of reconciliation with Sir
Robert. The King, who always hated him, easily
yielded to make Sir Paul Methuen Secretary of State
in his room; but the greater power of Sir Robert with
the Queen (whose policy had long been employed in
keeping open the breach, in order to govern both),
saved the Duke for future scenes of perfidy<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and
ingratitude.</p>

<p>Towards the decline of Sir Robert Walpole’s Ministry,
the Duke of Newcastle, who feared to fall with
him, and hoped to rise upon his ruins, dealt largely
with the Opposition, to compass both. The late Duke
of Argyle, after that Minister’s defeat, and his own
disappointment in not succeeding to a greater portion
of power, commissioned his brother, Lord Islay, to
tell Sir Robert, that the Duke of Newcastle and the
Chancellor had long been in league with himself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Lord Granville to effect his ruin. Lord Granville
was scarce warm in power before Newcastle betrayed
him to Lord Chesterfield; and the latter having introduced
Lord Sandwich, who was sent Minister to
the Hague, this young statesman and the Duke of
Newcastle kept the secrets of his own office from Lord
Harrington, who had been restored to the place of
Secretary of State, for the assistance he had lent in
overturning Lord Granville. On Lord Harrington’s
discovering and resenting this treachery, the Seals
were given to Lord Chesterfield; but he being, like
his predecessors, excluded from all trust the moment
he had a right to be trusted, soon resigned them. The
Duke of Newcastle, who had newly entered into connexions
with the Duke of Bedford, (as he and his
brother did successively with every chief of a faction,
till they had taken out their stings by dividing them
from their party, and then discarded them) wished
to give the Seals to Murray, who was, or to Pitt, who
was canvassing to be, his creature; but the Duke of
Bedford abruptly and positively insisted on having
them&mdash;and had [them, together with] their constant
perquisites,&mdash;the Duke of Newcastle’s suspicions and
treachery.</p>

<p>The Duke of Newcastle had no pride, though infinite
self-love: jealousy was the great source of all
his faults. He always caressed his enemies, to list
them against his friends; there was no service he
would not do for either, till either was above being
served by him: then he would suspect they did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
love him enough; for the moment they had every
reason to love him, he took every method to obtain
their hate, by exerting all his power for their ruin.
There was no expense to which he was not addicted,
but generosity. His houses, gardens, table, and
equipage, swallowed immense treasures: the sums he
owed were only exceeded by those he wasted. He
loved business immoderately, yet was only always
doing it, never did it. His speeches in Council and
Parliament were flowing and copious of words, but
empty and unmeaning: his professions extravagant,
for he would profess intentions of doing more service
to many men, than he even did hurt to others.
Always inquisitive to know what was said of him, he
wasted in curiosity the time in which he might have
earned praise. He aimed at everything; endeavoured
nothing. Fear,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> a ridiculous fear, was predominant
in him; he would venture the overthrow of the Government,
and hazard his life and fortunes rather
than dare to open a letter that might discover a plot.
He was a Secretary of State without intelligence, a
Duke without money, a man of infinite intrigue, without
secrecy or policy, and a Minister despised and hated
by his master, by all parties and Ministers, without
being turned out by any!</p>

<p>It may appear extraordinary that Mr. Pelham, who
had not so much levity in his character, should consent
to be an accomplice in his brother’s treacheries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
especially as upon every interval of rivalship, the
Duke grew jealous of him. The truth was, that Mr.
Pelham, who had as much envy<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> in his temper, and
still more fondness for power, was willing to take
advantage of his brother’s fickleness, and reaped all
the emolument without incurring the odium of it.
He had lived in friendship with Sir Robert Walpole,
Lord Chesterfield, and the Duke of Bedford;
while his brother was notoriously betraying them
shrugged up his shoulders, condemned the Duke, tried
to make peace, but never failed to profit of their ruin
the moment it was accomplished. The falsehood and
frivolousness of their behaviour can never appear in
a stronger light than it did in the present instance,
and in all the transactions that relate to Lord Granville.
That Lord had hurried into power on Sir
Robert Walpole’s disgrace, and declared he would be
a Page of the Back Stairs rather than ever quit the
Court again. He had no sooner quitted his party,
who had long suspected him, than he openly declared
himself a protector of Sir Robert Walpole; and to
give the finishing stroke to his interest with the King,
drove deep into all his Majesty’s Hanoverian politics,
persuaded, in spite of the recent instance before his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
eyes, that whoever governed the King, must govern
the kingdom.</p>

<p>His person<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> was handsome, open, and engaging;
his eloquence at once rapid and pompous, and by the
mixture, a little bombast.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> He was an extensive
scholar, master of classic criticism, and of all modern
politics. He was precipitate in his manner, and rash
in his projects; but, though there was nothing he
would not attempt, he scarce ever took any measures
necessary to the accomplishment. He would profess
amply, provoke indiscriminately, oblige seldom. It is
difficult to say whether he was oftener intoxicated
by wine or ambition: in fits of the former, he showed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>contempt for every body; in rants of the latter, for
truth. His genius was magnificent and lofty; his
heart without gall or friendship, for he never tried to
be revenged on his enemies, or to serve his friends.
One of the latter, Lord Chief-Justice Willes, being
complimented on Lord Granville’s return to Court,
replied, “He my friend! He is nobody’s friend: I
will give you a proof. Sir Robert Walpole had promised
me to make my friend Clive one of the King’s
Council; but too late! I asked him to request it of
Mr. Pelham, who promised, but did not perform.
When Lord Granville was in the height of his power,
I one day said to him, ‘My Lord, you are going to the
King; do ask him to make poor Clive one of his
Council.’ He replied, ‘What is it to me who is a Judge,
or who a Bishop? It is my business to make Kings
and Emperors, and to maintain the balance of Europe.’
Willes replied, ‘Then they who want to be Bishops
and Judges will apply to those who will submit to
make it their business.’” I will mention one other
short instance of his style. When, during his power,
he had a mind to turn out the Chancellor, and prefer
Willes, he said to Mr. Pelham, “I made Willes Chief
Justice.” “You may make him more if you please,
and perhaps will,” replied Mr. Pelham, “but I thought
Sir Robert Walpole made him Chief Justice.” “No,
it was I: I will tell you how: I knew him at Oxford;
Queen Anne’s Ministry had caught him scribbling
libels: I had even then an interest with men in power&mdash;I
saved him from the pillory&mdash;now, you know, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
he had stood in the pillory, Sir Robert Walpole could
never have made him a Judge.”</p>

<p>He carried this extravagance into his whole behaviour:
divided Europe, portioned out the spoils of
the King of Prussia, conquered France&mdash;and all these
visionary victories, without deigning to cultivate the
least interest in the House of Commons, where the
Pelhams were undermining like moles, and thinking
as little of Europe&mdash;as ever they did afterwards. Pitt,
who was building fame by attacking this Quixote
Minister, received profuse incense from Mr. Pelham;
while Lord Granville kept no measures of decency
with his new associates. He treated the Duke of
Newcastle, the Chancellor, and Lord Harrington, with
unmeasurable contempt, and would not suffer their
patience to be, what their tempers inclined them to
be, the humblest of his slaves. These men, who, if
they had any talents, had the greatest art that ever I
knew at decrying those they wanted to undo, soon
kindled such a flame in the nation, that the King
was forced to part with his favourite, and all his airy
schemes of German glory. Lord Granville had endeavoured
early, by the intervention of Lord Hervey,
to unite with Sir Robert Walpole, but he absolutely
declined it, being persuaded that Lord Granville had
connexions with the Pretender,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> which, if he ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
had, he now and long since had undoubtedly broken
off. In their distress to get rid of their great antagonist,
the Pelhams had recourse to Sir Robert
Walpole. I don’t know whether the Duke of Newcastle,
like another King-making Warwick, would not
even have offered to raise him again to the height
from which he had tumbled him, had he stipulated for
any terms. Lord Orford, who the year before had by
his single interest prevented the rejection of the
Hanover troops, now came again to town, and having
been instructed by John Selwyn, who was dispatched
to meet him upon the road, wrote a letter to the King,
which prevailed upon him to dismiss his Minister.</p>

<p>The Pelhams then entered into a coalition with the
Duke of Bedford, Lord Chesterfield, Pitt, and that
faction, which went on tolerably smooth, till Pitt’s
impatience to be Secretary at War opened the door to
a new scene. Lord Bath and Lord Granville, who
still preserved connexions with the King, through the
intervention of my Lady Yarmouth, persuaded him
not to admit that incendiary into his closet. The
Pelhams discovered from whence the rub came; and
growing apprehensive that as soon as the session should
be closed, and the Supplies completed, they should be
discarded, not only determined to resign their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
places, but engaged the whole body of the King’s
Ministers and servants, down to the lowest clerks in
offices, in a league of throwing up their employments
in order to distress their master: and the whole nation,
which for four years together had seemed possessed
with a madness of seizing places, now ran into the
opposite phrensy of quitting them&mdash;and must not it
be told:&mdash;or will it be credited, if it is told?&mdash;The
period they chose for this unwarrantable insult, was
the height of a Rebellion; the King was to be forced
into compliance with their views, or their allegiance
was in a manner ready to be offered to the competitor
for his Crown, then actually wrestling for it in the
heart of his kingdom! A flagrancy of ingratitude and
treachery not to be paralleled, but by the behaviour
of the Parliament at the beginning of the Civil War,
who connived at the Irish Rebellion, in order to charge
King Charles with fomenting it. What attention
they had already exerted for suppressing the Rebellion,
appears from Sir John Cope’s trial, where, in answer
to his repeated memorials for succours, and representations
of the young Pretender being actually in Scotland
and in arms, the Council tell him, “That they
are unwilling to send him supplies, for fear of alarming
people.”</p>

<p>This general banding of the King’s servants against
him, joined to Lord Granville’s neglect of all precaution
to strengthen himself by a party, had the desired
effect. He had offered the Seals to Willes but the
very day of the execution of their scheme, who prudently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
declined them. Winnington, though far from
being a friend to Mr. Pelham, and wishing well to
Lord Granville, yet understood his own interest too
well to undertake the management of the House of
Commons, and was at last forced to mediate the parley
between the King and the mutineers. Lord Granville
took the Seals, which Lord Harrington had been the first
to resign, and sent for Lord Cholmondeley from Chester
to take the others. This was<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> a vain empty man,
shoved up too high by his father-in-law, Sir Robert
Walpole, and fallen into contempt and obscurity by
his own extravagance and insufficiency. Lord Winchelsea,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
who had been at the head of the Admiralty on
the first change, and the only man who had raised his
character (by his conduct at that Board) when the
rest of his friends had sunk theirs, was again named to
that dignity; and Lord Bath at last obtained that
object of his every passion, the government of the
Treasury. The other employments they had not time
to fill up, for on the third day of this meteor-like
Ministry, no volunteers coming in, business at a stand,
the nation in astonishment, and the Parliament in indignation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>the two Lords were forced to tell the King,
that he must once more part with them, and submit to
his old governors. Lord Granville left St. James’s
laughing; Lord Bath slipped down the back stairs,
leaving Lord Carlisle in the outward room, expecting
to be called in to kiss hands for the Privy Seal.</p>

<p>The King sent for Winnington, and commissioned
him to invite the deserters to return to their posts.
Winnington<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> had been bred a Tory, but had left them
in the height of Sir Robert Walpole’s power: when
that Minister sunk, he had injudiciously, and to please
my Lady Townshend, who had then the greatest influence
over him, declined visiting him in a manner to
offend the steady old Whigs; and his jolly way of
laughing at his own want of principles had revolted all
the graver sort, who thought deficiency of honesty too
sacred and profitable a commodity to be profaned and
turned into ridicule. He had infinitely more wit than
any man I ever knew, and it was as ready and quick
as it was constant and unmeditated. His style was a
little brutal; his courage not at all so; his good-humour
inexhaustible: it was impossible to hate or to
trust him. He died soon after by the ignorance of a
quack,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> when he stood in the fairest point of rising,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>to the great satisfaction of Mr. Pelham, whom he rivalled
and despised.</p>

<p>The <em>ligue</em>, who had retired for no other end, did
not make the King expect them long. Lord Harrington
alone, when Mr. Pelham announced to him
the summons for their return, said, “Go back!&mdash;yes,
but not without conditions.” One was, that Lord
Granville should give up the promise of the Garter;
which he did&mdash;but got while out of place, and saw
Lord Harrington sacrificed to the King’s resentments.</p>

<p>The King had fewer sensations of revenge, or at
least knew how to hoard them better than any man
who ever sat upon a Throne. The insults he experienced
from his own, and those obliged servants,
never provoked him enough to make him venture the
repose of his people, or his own. If any object of his
hate fell in his way, he did not pique himself upon
heroic forgiveness, but would indulge it at the expence
of his integrity, though not of his safety. He was
reckoned strictly honest; but the burning his father’s
will<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> must be an indelible blot upon his memory;
as a much later instance of his refusing to pardon a
young man<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> who had been condemned at Oxford for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>most trifling forgery, contrary to all example when
recommended to mercy by the Judge; merely because
Willes, who was attached to the Prince of Wales, had
tried him, and assured him his pardon, will stamp his
name with cruelty, though in general his disposition
was merciful, if the offence was not murder. His
avarice was much less equivocal than his courage: he
had distinguished the latter early;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> it grew more
doubtful afterwards: the former he distinguished very
near as soon,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and never deviated from it. His understanding
was not near so deficient, as it was
imagined; but though his character changed extremely
in the world, it was without foundation; for [whether]
he deserved to be so much ridiculed as he had been
in the former part of his reign, or so respected as in
the latter, he was consistent in himself, and uniformly
meritorious or absurd.</p>

<p>His other passions were, Germany, the Army,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and
women. Both the latter had a mixture of parade in
them: he [treated] my Lady Suffolk, and afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>Lady Yarmouth, as his mistresses, while he admired
only the Queen; and never described what he thought
a handsome woman, but he drew her picture. Lady
Suffolk<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> was sensible, artful, and agreeable, but had
neither sense nor art enough to make him think her so
agreeable as his wife. When she had left him, tired
of acting the mistress, while she had in reality all the
slights of a wife, and no interest with him, the Opposition
affected to cry up her virtue, and the obligations
the King had to her for consenting to seem his mistress,
while in reality she had confined him to mere
friendship&mdash;a ridiculous pretence, as he was the last
man in the world to have taste for talking sentiments,
and that with a woman who was deaf!<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Lady Yarmouth<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
was inoffensive, and attentive only to pleasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>him, and to selling Peerages whenever she had an
opportunity. The Queen had been admired and happy
for governing him by address; it was not then known
how easily he was to be governed by fear.</p>

<p>Indeed there were few arts by which he was not
governed at some time or other of his life; for not to
mention the late Duke of Argyle, who grew a favourite
by imposing himself upon him for brave; nor Lord
Wilmington,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> who imposed himself upon him for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Lord knows what; the Queen governed him by dissimulation,
by affected tenderness and deference:<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Sir
Robert Walpole by abilities and influence in the House
of Commons; Lord Granville by flattering him in his
German politics; the Duke of Newcastle by teazing
and betraying him; Mr. Pelham by bullying him,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
only man by whom Mr. Pelham was not bullied
himself. Who indeed had not sometimes weight with
the King, except his children and his mistresses?
With them he maintained all the reserve and majesty
of his rank. He had the haughtiness of Henry the
Eighth, without his spirit; the avarice of Henry the
Seventh, without his exactions; the indignities of
Charles the First, without his bigotry for his prerogative;
the vexations of King William, with as little
skill in the management of parties; and the gross
gallantry of his father, without his goodnature or his
honesty:&mdash;he might, perhaps, have been honest, if he
had never hated his father, or had ever loved his
son.</p>

<p>Of all the resigners, the Duke of Grafton had
treated his master with the greatest decency: he had
retired to hunt, according to his custom, on the first
scent of a storm; and it was with the greatest reluctance
that he was forced to declare himself for any
Ministry that was in a disputable situation: nothing
could have forced him to it but the inequality of the
dispute. When he went into the closet, he told the
King, as if laughing at those he sided with, “Sir,
I am come to direct you who shall be your Minister.”</p>

<p>The Duke of Grafton<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> was a very extraordinary
man; with very good common sense and knowledge of
mankind, he contrived to be generally thought a fool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and by being thought so, contrived to be always well
at Court, and to have it not remarked that he was so:
yet he would sometimes boast of having been a short
time in Opposition, and of having early resolved never
to be so again. He had a lofty person, with great
dignity; great slowness in his delivery, which he
managed with humour. He had the greatest penetration
in finding out the foibles of men that ever I knew,
and wit in teazing them. He was insensible to misfortunes
of his own<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> or of his friends: understood the
Court perfectly, and looking upon himself as of the
Blood Royal, he thought nothing ought to affect
him, but what touched them: as he had no opportunity
of forsaking them for a family to which he
was more nearly related, one must not say he would
have forsaken them: betraying was never his talent;
he was content to be ungrateful, when his benefactors
were grown unhappy. He was careless of his
fortune, and provided against nothing but a storm
that might remove him from his station. An instance
once broke out of his having ambition to something
more than barely adorning the Court. On the
Queen’s death, whom he always hated, teazed, yet
praised to the King, he was imprudent enough in a
private conversation with Sir Robert Walpole and the
Duke of Newcastle, to dispute with the latter, whose
the power should be, both silently agreeing, fools
as they were, in his very presence, that it was no
longer to be Sir Robert’s. Grafton thinking to honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
him enough by letting him act under him, said at last
in a great passion to t’other Duke, “My Lord, sole
Minister I am not capable of being; first Minister, by
G&mdash;, I will be.” The foundation of either’s hopes
lay in their credit with Princess Emily, who was
suspected of having been as kind to Grafton’s love, as
she would have been unkind in yielding to Newcastle’s,
who made exceeding bustle about her, but
was always bad at executing all business. The
Queen had in reality a thorough aversion to the
Duke of Grafton for the liberties he took with one of
her great blood; and if she had not been prevented
by Sir Robert Walpole, would one night have complained
to the King, when the Princess and the Duke,
who hunted two or three times a week together, had
staid out unusually late, lost their attendants, and
gone together to a private house in Windsor Forest.
The Queen hated him too for letting her see he knew
her. He always teazed her, and insisted that she
loved nobody. He had got a story of some Prince in
Germany,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> that she had been in love with before her
marriage: “G&mdash;, madam,” he used to say, “I wish I
could have seen that man that you <em>could</em> love!”
“Why,” replied she, “do you think I don’t love the
King?” “G&mdash;, I wish I was King of France, and I
would be sure whether you do or not!”</p>

<p>Princess Emily detached herself from that cabal,
and united with her brother the Duke and the Bedfords.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
She was meanly inquisitive into what did not
relate to her, and foolishly communicative of what
was below her to know: false without trying to please,
mischievous with more design, impertinent even
where she had no resentment; and insolent, though
she had lost her beauty, and acquired no power. After
her father’s death, she lived with great dignity; but
being entirely slighted by her nephew, who was afraid
of her frankness, she soon forbore going to Court or
to keep a Drawing-room herself, on pretence of her
increased deafness. She was extremely deaf, and very
short-sighted; yet had so much quickness and conception,
that she seemed to hear and see more readily
than others. She was an excellent mistress to her
servants, steady to her favourites, and nobly generous
and charitable.</p>

<p>When the Pelhams were returned to Court, they for
some time sat but loose in the King’s affections. The
Duke of Newcastle had long been used to be called
names by his master; and of whatever breach of duty
he was guilty, he took care to submit with patience
to abuse from his Sovereign. Mr. Pelham having
more pride, was more resty under ill treatment, and
soon threatened again to resign. The King, who
would not venture again suddenly to be making
Ministers upon his own authority, asked him who he
wished should succeed him? He said peevishly,
“Winnington.” “No,” said the King; “you know
he is too much your friend.” “I had rather,” replied
Mr. Pelham, “you would give my place to Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Granville than keep it.” “That is better still!” said
the King; “you make it impossible for him to have
it, and then want me to give it to him!”</p>

<p>If that three-days’ Ministry had lasted, Lord Hartington,
as errant a bigot to the Pelham faction as
ever Jacques Clement was to the Jesuits, had offered
to impeach Lord Granville&mdash;so soon had Sir Robert
Walpole’s friends forgot the abhorrence they had expressed
for the motion to remove him without a cause;
and so little do the silly bravos of a party foresee
how soon they may be brought to adopt and refine
upon the most unjustifiable excesses of their antagonists!
This new violence was the more odious than
its precedent, as here was a man to be impeached only
because he was going to be an unpopular Minister!
In four years, Lord Granville and Lord Hartington
came into place together!</p>

<p>The Duke of Newcastle, who had conquered every
obstacle to power, but the aversion of his master,
began to think he might as well add his favour to the
other attributes of a Minister; and having overturned
Lord Granville for his German adulation, was so equitable
as to make the King amends by giving into all
excess of it himself. There was one impediment; he
had never been out of England, and dreaded the sea.
After having consulted his numerous band of physicians<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
and apothecaries, he at last ventured; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
himself and his gold plate,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> and his mad Duchess,
under a thousand various convoys, treated Europe
with a more ridiculous spectacle than any it had seen
since Caligula’s cockle-shell triumph.</p>

<p>He was now at the height of his wishes, but was
still unsatisfied. The connexion of the Duke with
Lord Sandwich, and through him with the Duke of
Bedford, had given him the uneasiness that was mentioned
at the beginning of these Memoirs; and the
Prince’s death having smoothed all opposition, it was
determined by the brothers in their Cabinet Council,
to dismiss their rivals, whose interest in the House of
Commons could now turn no scale into which it
might be thrown. The measure was taken to remove
Lord Sandwich, and thereby provoke the Duke of
Bedford to resign; or to give the latter some more
insignificant post, as Master of the Horse, President
of the Council, or Master of the Ordnance. Mr. Fox,
who saw the insult that was aimed at the Duke, endeavoured
as much as possible to save his honour, by
persuading the Duke of Bedford to acquiesce in the
latter plan, as he would have more opportunities of
crossing his enemies while he staid at Court, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
probability of returning thither if once totally removed.
Lord Sandwich laboured the same point, and
even hoped to be overlooked if he could persuade the
Duke of Bedford to accept one of the other less obnoxious
employments; but the Duke was swayed to
the contrary opinion.</p>

<p>He was a man of inflexible honesty, and good-will
to his country: his great economy was called avarice;
if it was so, it was blended with more generosity and
goodness than that passion will commonly unite with.
His parts were certainly far from shining, and yet he
spoke readily, and upon trade, well: his foible was
speaking upon every subject, and imagining he understood
it, as he must have done, by inspiration.
He was always governed; generally by the Duchess,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
though immeasurably obstinate, when once he had
formed or had an opinion instilled into him. His
manner was impetuous, of which he was so little sensible,
that being told Lord Halifax was to succeed
him, he said, “He is too warm and overbearing; the
King will never endure him.” If the Duke of Bedford
could have thought less well of himself, the world
would probably have thought better of him.</p>

<p>His friend Lord Sandwich<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> was of a very different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>character; in nothing more than in the inflexibility of
his honesty. The Duke of Bedford loved money, to use
it sensibly and with kindness to others; Lord Sandwich
was rapacious, but extravagant when it was to
promote his own designs. His industry to carry any
point he had in view was so remarkable, that for a
long time the world mistook it for abilities; but as
his manner was most awkward and unpolished, so his
talents were but slight, when it was necessary to exert
them in any higher light than in art and intrigue.
The King had never forgiven his indecent reflections<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
upon the Electorate when he was in Opposition, and
as soon as ever he found his Ministers would permit
him to show his resentment, he took all occasions to pay
his court to them by treating Lord Sandwich ill, particularly
by talking to Lord Anson before him on all
matters relating to the fleet. An incident (one should
have thought quite foreign to the Administration)
contributed to give the King a new handle to use
Lord Sandwich with indignity: the Bedfords had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
transacted a marriage between one of the Duchess’s
sisters<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and Colonel Waldegrave, against the consent
of her father, Lord Gower; and Lord Sandwich had
been so imprudent as to let the ceremony be performed
at his apartments at the Admiralty. The
Pelhams, who always inoculated private quarrels on
affairs of state, dispatched my Lord Gower to ask a
formal audience of the King, and complain of Lord
Sandwich’s contributing to steal his daughter. Lord
Gower<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> was a comely man of form, had never had
any sense, and was now superannuated. He had been
educated a stiff Jacobite, elected their chief on his
first coming into the King’s service, and had twice
taken the Privy Seal before he could determine to
change his principles. The King entered into his
quarrel; and the Pelhams by this artifice detached
him from his family, and persuaded him that to
resign with them would be sacrificing himself in the
cause of Lord Sandwich, who had offered him such
an indignity.</p>

<p>When Lord Sandwich found his disgrace unavoidable,
and even had got intelligence of the day on
which he was to be dismissed, he endeavoured by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>own solicitations, and by the interposition of the
Duke, to prevail on the Duke of Bedford to throw up
the Seals first. This finesse, which did not succeed,
was calculated to prevent the appearance of the Duke
of Bedford’s resigning upon his account, and consequently
the new obligations to be laid upon him by
that measure: governing that Duke no longer, he
chose to be no longer connected with him; but Bedford
now would neither stay in, nor go out by his advice.</p>

prevail on Yorke to quit a place for life for the higher but
more precarious dignity of Chancellor, worked upon his jealousy,
and said, that if he persisted in refusing the Seals, he
must offer them to Fazakerley. “Fazakerley!” exclaimed
Yorke; “impossible! he is certainly a Tory, perhaps a Jacobite.”
“It’s all very true,” replied Sir Robert, taking out his
watch, “but if by one o’clock you do not accept my offer,
Fazakerley by two becomes Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and
one of the <em>staunchest Whigs in all England</em>.” Yorke took the
Seals and the Peerage.&mdash;E.</p></div>

up the Lord North and Grey, who was deeply engaged. The
instant the meeting broke up, which was very late at night,

that Lord lived, to give him notice; and when the messengers

<p><a name="Footnote_154_154" id="Footnote_154_154"></a><a href="#FNanchor_154_154"><span class="label">[154]</span></a> Sir Spencer Compton, son of the Earl of Northampton, was
Speaker of the House of Commons and Knight of the Bath in
the reign of King George the First. On the accession of the
present King, when Sir Robert Walpole went to receive his
orders, he bad him go for them to Sir Spencer Compton. This
was a plain declaration! The first business was to prepare the
new King’s speech to his Privy Council, which the new Minister
was so little able to draw, that he was forced to apply for it to
the old one, who drew it&mdash;willingly, it may be believed; and
the Queen knew how to make the request and condescension
have their effects. He was then created Baron, and afterwards
Earl of Wilmington and Knight of the Garter, and made President
of the Council. On the resignation of Sir Robert Walpole,
he succeeded him as First Lord of the Treasury, with the new
Commissioners, but had so little influence even at that Board,
that Sandys, Rushout, and Gybbon, used to put the disposal of
places to the vote, and carry them against him and his nephew
Compton. He died in about a year and a half after he had
been raised to this uneasy situation. He was the most formal
solemn man in the world, but a great lover of private debauchery:
after missing the first Ministership, he entered into a secret
league with Mr. Pulteney, which Sir R. Walpole discovered by
the means of Mr. Pulteney’s gentleman, who betrayed to him
the letter he was carrying from his master to Lord Wilmington.
As this was soon after a treaty between them, Lord Wilmington
was much shocked when Sir Robert reproached him with it, and
continued so steady for the future, that when the famous motion
was made against that Minister, he went to vote in the House
of Lords with a blister on his head, after having been confined
to his bed for some days with a fever.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_155_155" id="Footnote_155_155"></a><a href="#FNanchor_155_155"><span class="label">[155]</span></a> She always affected, if anybody was present, to act (and he
liked she should) the humble ignorant wife, that never meddled
with politics. Even if Sir Robert Walpole came in to talk of
business, which she had previously settled with him, she would
rise up, curtsey, and offer to retire; the King generally bad her
stay, sometimes not. She and Sir Robert played him into
one another’s hands. He would refuse to take the advice of the
one, and then when the other talked to him again upon the same
point, he would give the reasons for it which had been suggested
to him: nay, he would sometimes produce as his own, at another
conversation to the same person, the reasons which he had refused
to listen to when given him. He has said to Sir Robert, on the
curtseys of the Queen, “There, you see how much I am
governed by my wife, as they say I am! Hoh! hoh! it is a
fine thing indeed to be governed by one’s wife!” “Oh! sir,”
replied the Queen, “I must be vain indeed to pretend to govern
your Majesty!”</p></div>

<p>June 13th.&mdash;The Duke of Newcastle wrote to Lord
Sandwich, that the King had no farther occasion for
his service; and in the evening sent Mr. Legge to
acquaint the Duke of Bedford with the dismission of
his friend. Legge was a younger son of Lord Dartmouth,
who had early turned him into the world to
make his fortune, which he pursued with an uncommon
assiduity of duty. Avarice or flattery, application
or ingratitude, nothing came amiss that might
raise him on the ruins of either friends or enemies;
indeed, neither were so to him, but by the proportion
of their power. He had been introduced to Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Robert Walpole by his second son, and soon grew an
immeasurable favourite, till endeavouring to steal his
patron’s daughter,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> at which in truth Sir Robert’s
partiality for him had seemed to connive, he was discarded
entirely; yet taken care<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> of in the very last
hours of that Minister’s power; and though removed
from the Secretaryship of the Treasury, being particularly
obnoxious to Lord Bath, he obtained a profitable
employment<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> by the grossest supplications<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> to the
Duke of Bedford; and was soon after admitted into
the Admiralty by as gross court paid to Lord Winchelsea,
whom he used ill the moment he found it
necessary to worship that less intense but more
surely-rising sun, Mr. Pelham. He had a peculiarity
of wit and very shrewd parts, but was a dry
and generally an indifferent speaker. On a chosen
embassy to the King of Prussia, Legge was duped and
ill-treated by him. Having shuffled for some time
between Mr. Pelham, Pitt, the Duke of Bedford, and
Lord Sandwich, and wriggled through the interest of
all into the Treasury, and then to the Treasurership
of the Navy, he submitted to break his connexions
with the two latter by being the indecent messenger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>of Lord Sandwich’s disgrace. The Duke met him on
the steps of Bedford-house (as he was going to Lord
Gower to know what part he would take on this
crisis) and would scarce give him audience; but even
that short interview could not save Legge from the confusion
he felt at his own policy; and with the awkwardness
that conscience will give even to an ambassador,
he said, he had happened, as he was just going out of
town, to visit the Duke of Newcastle, where he had
not been in two months before, and had been requested
by him to be the bearer of this notification.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford, who carried Lord Trentham
with him, found Lord Gower in no humour to resign
with him; on the contrary, enraged at his son, who
told him he could not serve under Lord Anson, the
new head of the Admiralty. “Sir,” said his father,
“he is your superior; he is a Peer.” “Who made
him so?” replied Lord Trentham. Lord Gower told
the Duke of Bedford that he had listed all his children
against him; and threatened Lord Trentham to disinherit
him of all that was in his power; who told
him in pretty plain terms, how much he was a dupe
to the Pelhams; and after many high words, they
both left him.</p>

<p>When the Duke of Bedford arrived at Kensington,
he found none of the opposite faction but Lord Lincoln,
whom he desired to acquaint the Duke of Newcastle
with what he was going to say to the King.
“Tell him, my Lord, because perhaps he would not
like to come in and hear it; I shall neither say more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
or less for his presence or absence. If he comes into
the closet and begins to dispute, I will not altercate
with him there; I will afterwards wherever he pleases.”
When he went in to the King, he spoke above an hour
warmly and sensibly on his own grievances, particularly
on the Duke of Dorset being designed Lord
Lieutenant for six months before he was made acquainted
with it; on his relation, Lord Hartington,
being named in the same manner for the Master of
the Horse, and called up to the House of Peers, for
which he had that very morning kissed hands; on the
dismission of his friend Lord Sandwich; and on all
the treacheries of the Duke of Newcastle, which he
recapitulated, and the scenes of mischief which Mr.
Pelham had been acting in Lord Gower’s family: and
he concluded with telling the King, that their persecution
of him and Lord Sandwich arose solely from
their attachment to his son the Duke; and then desired
leave to resign the Seals. The King was struck
and pleased with this remonstrance; agreed to all
he had said of the Duke of Newcastle; doubted of the
facts charged on Mr. Pelham; and with regard to
Lord Sandwich, only said, “I don’t know how it is,
but he has very few friends.” He told the Duke of
Bedford, that if he was uneasy in his present post, he
would give him that of President; but the Duke said
it was impossible for him to act with the two brothers.
He begged three reversions in the Secretary’s office
for his two secretaries, Mr. Leveson and Mr. Aldworth,
and his steward Butcher; to which the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
deferred giving an answer till next day, but then
granted them; and parted with him with particular
marks of favour and approbation.</p>

<p>As soon as the Duke of Bedford had resigned, Lord
Trentham sent his resignation in a very explicit letter
to Mr. Pelham, in which he spoke warmly on malicious
people who had prejudiced his father against him.
Mr. Pelham, who could neither avoid doing wrong
nor bear to be told of it, was inconceivably stung with
this reproach; and as if shifting off the consequence
would clear him from being the cause, he would have
waved accepting the resignation, sending Lord Trentham
word that he was misinstructed in sending it to
him, who had no authority to receive it, but yet was
sorry for what he was doing.</p>

<p>17th.&mdash;Lord Granville was appointed President of
the Council, Lord Hartington Master of the Horse,
Lord Albemarle Groom of the Stole, Lord Anson First
Lord, and the Admirals Boscawen and Rowley Commissioners
of the Admiralty; the latter attached to
Lord Granville, the other to nothing but his own
opinion. He was on the worst terms with Anson,
who had carried off all the glory of the victory at
Cape Finisterre, though Boscawen had done the service,
and whom he suspected of having sent him on the
impracticable expedition to Pondicherry on purpose
to ruin him. Lord Anson was reserved and proud,
and so ignorant of the world, that Sir Charles Williams
said he had been round it, but never in it. He had
been strictly united with the Duke of Bedford and Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Sandwich, but not having the same command of his
ambition that he had of his other passions, he had not
been able to refuse the offer of the Chancellor’s daughter,
nor the direction of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>Lord Hartington, and his father, the Duke of
Devonshire,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> were the fashionable models of goodness,
though their chief merit was a habit of caution. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Duke’s outside was unpolished, his inside unpolishable.
The Marquis was more fashioned, but with an impatience
to do everything, and a fear to do nothing. Sir
Robert Walpole had set up the father as the standard
of Whiggism; in gratitude, he was constantly bigoted
to whoever passed for head of the Whigs: but the
dexterity of raising his son to so eminent a post as
Master of the Horse during his own life, and obtaining
a Peerage for his own son-in-law,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> by retiring
from power himself, extremely lessened the value of
the rough diamond<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> that he had hitherto contrived to
be thought.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>However, the Whigs were so satisfied with the promotion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>of Lord Hartington, that they overlooked the
conjunction of Lord Granville, though so little time
had passed since they had been enrolled in a crusade
against him; and it would have been difficult for the
Pelhams to have told what they had done to give Lord
Granville a higher opinion of them, or what he had
done to give them a lower opinion of him: what had
happened to make him feel less contempt for them; or
they to see less danger in him. So little reason had
they to expect better union with him, that when he
was wished joy on their reconciliation, he replied, “I
am the King’s President; I know nothing of the
Pelhams; I have nothing to do with them.” The
very day he kissed hands, he told Lord D <span class="nowrap">****,</span> one of
the dirtiest of their creatures, “Well, my Lord, here
is the common enemy returned!” Nugent, the Sancho
Pança of this Quixote, began to beat up for volunteers
for him; and himself made large overtures to Fox,
desired to have some private conversation with him
at Holland House, and told him he would reconcile
himself to the Duke. Fox replied, “They have paved
your way.” Lord Granville the next day repeated
this conversation to Mr. Pelham, with the only difference
of inverting the persons of the speakers, and
ascribing to Fox all the overtures that had come from
himself. Two or three of his inferior dependents
were promoted, but no mention made of his fellow
martyrs.</p>

<p>On the 18th appeared the last and greatest phenomenon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Lord Holderness,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> who had been fetched
from his Embassy in Holland to be Secretary of
State. In reality, he did justice to himself and his
patrons, for he seemed ashamed of being made so
considerable, for no reason but because he was so
inconsiderable. He had a formality in his manner
that would have given an air of truth to what he said,
if he would but have assisted it with the least regard
to probability; but this made his narrations harmless,
for they were totally incredible. His passion for
directing operas and masquerades was rather thought
a contradiction to his gravity, than below his understanding,
which was so very moderate, that no relation
of his own exploits would, not a little time before, have
been sooner credited, than his being made Secretary of
State. What contributed a little to make the King consent
to this wonderful promotion was his mother, Lady
Fitzwalter, being distantly related to the Royal Family.
The Queen and Princesses always talked to her in
French, though she had never been out of England,
because her ancestors came originally from Germany.</p>

<p>When the King delivered the Seals to Lord Holderness
in the presence of the Duke of Newcastle, he
charged him to mind only the business of his province;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
telling him that of late the Secretary’s office
had been turned into a mere office of faction. The
Duke of Newcastle, who understood the reprimand,
and Lord Holderness, who did not, complained equally
of the lecture. The former could not well complain
of any direct chiding; for the King, who had parted
with the Duke of Bedford, to quiet his wayward
humour, to revenge the Duke of Bedford would not
speak to the Duke of Newcastle for some weeks; an
excuse he made advantage of pleading to the Duke of
Marlborough, who had solicited for a Prebend of
Windsor; and to Lord Halifax, who was pushing to
get the West Indies entirely subjected to the Board
of Trade, and to be nominated a third Secretary of
State for that quarter of the world. As Lord Halifax
persisted in this demand, and the Duke of Newcastle
did not care to push the King any further, especially
in the tender article of new appointments, Lord Holderness
was made to taste of the servile uses for which
he was introduced, and ordered to solicit the King to
take so fair a feather from his own command as the
direction of the West Indies; but for this time the
Monarch would not, and Lord Halifax, after many
vain threats, was forced to yield. He was<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> a man of
moderate sense, and of great application to raise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
credit of his employment; but warm, overbearing, and
ignorant of the world.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>25th.&mdash;The King put an end to the Session. The
Speaker touched but gently and artfully on the
Regency Bill; enough to show his disapprobation, and
not enough to reflect on the decision of the House;
praying for the King’s life, because of the difficulties
in which the Princess would be involved in a Regency
without Sovereignty.</p>

<p>The instant the Parliament was prorogued, the two
Sheriffs of London&mdash;I forget their names&mdash;accompanied
by Lord Carpenter and Sir George Vandeput, went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Newgate, released Murray, and conducted him in
paltry triumph to his own house. On the 28th, his
case, scurrilously written by one Whitehead,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> a factious
poet, was published, for which the printer was taken
into custody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In July</span>, the posthumous child of which the Princess
was delivered was christened. The Prince had
affected to baptize all his children by popular names;
but his wife being more prolific than the English
history, in heroes and heroines, the Edwards and Elizabeths
were exhausted, and he had been forced to go
back as far as the Conqueror’s daughter. The King
would not suffer the last Princess to be called
Matilda,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> but now, out of regard to his son’s memory,
indulged it.</p>

<p>Soon after the Prince died, an unlucky discovery
had been made. George Lyttelton had written a
lamentation, on that occasion, to his father,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> an antiquated
Baronet in Worcestershire, telling him that he
and his friends had just renewed their connexions
with the Prince of Wales, by the mediation of Dr.
Ayscough, which, though not ripe for discovery, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>the true secret of their oblique behaviour this session in
Parliament. This letter he had delivered to a gentleman’s
servant, who was going into that county; but
the fellow having some other letters for the post, had
by mistake given in the private negotiation, which
was only subscribed <em>To Sir Thomas Lyttelton</em>. It
was opened at the Post-office, and carried to Mr. Pelham.
Had it been seen by no other person, the
secret had been safe, and the treachery concealed, as
carefully as if he had been in the conspiracy himself,
instead of being the object of it; but it was talked of
from the Post-office, though obscurely for some time,
till at last it was nursed up somehow or other, and
arrived at the King’s ears, who grew outrageous, and
could not be hindered from examining Shelvocke, the
Secretary of the Post-office, himself. Here he got very
little further light; for Shelvocke had been instructed
to affirm that the letter was sent back to Mr. Lyttelton,
unopened; but Lyttelton, who had not been so well instructed
in his own secret, avowed it; and as if there
were nothing to be ashamed of but the discovery, he
took pains to palliate no other part of the story.</p>

<p>Absurdity was predominant in Lyttelton’s composition:
it entered equally into his politics, his apologies,
his public pretences, his private conversations. With
the figure of a spectre, and the gesticulations of a
puppet, he talked heroics through his nose, made
declamations at a visit, and played at cards with
scraps of history, or sentences of Pindar. He had set
out on a poetical love plan, though with nothing of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
lover but absence of mind, and nothing of poet but
absence of meaning; yet he was far from wanting
parts; spoke well when he had studied his speeches;
and loved to reward and promote merit in others.
His political apostasy was as flagrant as Pitt’s: the
latter gloried in it: but Lyttelton, when he had been
forced to quit virtue, took up religion, and endeavoured
to persuade mankind that he had just fixed
his views on heaven, when he had gone the greatest
lengths to promote his earthly interest; and so finished
was his absurdity, that he was capable of believing
himself honest and agreeable.</p>

<p>In the beginning of September came news of the
birth of a Duke of Burgundy; an event of the greatest
moment to France, but not received with their usual
transports. The Court had disgusted the clergy, by
demanding an account of their revenues. The priests,
equally ready at contriving or imputing an imposture,
persuaded half the nation that the child was spurious;
and to drive off the war from their own quarters, endeavoured
to light up or to lay the foundation of a
general war in the kingdom. The English Prelates
sent Harry the Fifth to the conquest of France, to
prevent a scrutiny of the same nature.</p>

<p>The same courier brought the Marquis de Mirepoix
a patent of Duke. He was much esteemed in England,
having little of the manners of his country, where he
had seldom lived; and except a passion which he retained
for dancing, and for the gracefulness of his own
figure, there was nothing in his character that did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
fall in naturally enough with the seriousness of the
English and German Courts,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> where he had been
Ambassador; nor any quickness of parts that could
have made him offensive, if our Ministry had been inclined
to take exceptions. Their suspicions seldom
ascended to enemies really formidable. They bore
with General Wall,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> an artful Irishman, Ambassador
from Spain, and who but last year had clandestinely
sent thither several of our woollen manufacturers.
Greater insults were shown to us at Paris and Berlin,
where Marshal Keith and Lord Tyrconnel, two outlawed
Jacobites, were reciprocally Ambassadors. Indeed,
it was a constant war of piques and affronts
between the King and his nephew of Prussia. The
latter had insisted <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'upon the recal'">upon the recall</ins> of Sir Charles Hanbury
Williams, who had sacrificed to the ruling
passion of the uncle, by treating the character of the
Prussian King, in his public dispatches and private
letters, in the strongest terms of satire.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> He returned
to Dresden, where, about this time, he concluded a
subsidiary treaty with the King of Poland, to engage
his vote for the Archduke Joseph to be King of the
Romans&mdash;the darling object of the ambition of the
Court of Vienna, and the common gulph of our profuse
politics. The King of Prussia openly, the French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>underhand, opposed the election. The very opposition
of the latter had a politic effect, as the longer it
remained in suspense, the longer would be the duration
of our extravagance. In one of the King of
Prussia’s rescripts, he taxed the King, whom he called
the last and youngest of the Electors, with violating
both his oath and the Golden Bull.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Hanbury Williams had been attached
to Mr. Winnington, and was the particular friend of
Fox. Towards the end of Sir Robert Walpole’s power,
they, Lord Hervey and Lord Ilchester, had forced the
last into the Secretaryship of the Treasury, against
the inclination of the Minister; an instance at that
time unparalleled; much copied since, as the Government
has fallen into weaker hands. Sir Charles
remained a steady friend to Walpole, and persecuted
his rival, Lord Bath, in a succession of satiric odes,
that did more execution in six months, than the
Craftsman had done in twice the number of years;
for the Minister only lost his power, but the patriot
his character. If Sir Charles had many superiors in
poetry, he had none in the wit of his poetry. In conversation
he was less natural, and overbearing: hated
with the greatest good-nature, and the most disinterested
generosity; for fools dreaded his satire&mdash;few
forgave his vanity. He had thrown up his place on
some disgusts; the loss of Mr. Winnington, and a
quarrel with the Irish, occasioned by an ode<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> he wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
on the marriage of the Duchess of Manchester and
Mr. Hussey, fomented by Lord Bath and his enemies,
and supported with too little spirit, had driven him to
shelter his discontents in a Foreign Embassy, where he
displayed great talents for negotiation, and pleased
as much by his letters, as he had formerly by his
poetry.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>On the 13th of the following month, an express
arrived of the death of the Prince of Orange, who,
having been at Aix la Chapelle, caught a fever on his
return, and died in five days.</p>

<p>He had long been kept out of all share in the
government, like his predecessor, King William; like
him, lifted to it in a tumultuous manner, on his
country being overrun by the French; and the Stad-holdership
made hereditary in his family before they
had time to experience how little he was qualified to
re-establish their affairs. Not that he wanted genius,
but he was vain and positive, a trifling lover of show,
and not master of the great lights in which he stood.
The Princess Royal was more positive, and, though
passionately imperious, had dashed all opportunities
that presented for the Prince’s distinguishing himself,
from immoderate jealousy and fondness for his person.
Yet the Mars who was locked in the arms of this
Venus, was a monster so deformed, that when the
King had chosen him for his son-in-law, he could not
help, in the honesty of his heart, and the coarseness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of his expression, telling the Princess how hideous a
bridegroom she was to expect, and even gave her permission
to refuse. She replied, she would marry him
if he was a baboon. Well then, said the King, there
is baboon enough for you!</p>

<p>The Princess immediately took the oaths as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gouvernante</i>
to her son, and all orders of men submitted to
her as quietly as in a monarchy of the most established
duration; though the opposite faction was numerous,
and she herself lethargic and in a very precarious state
of health. Lord Holderness was sent to condole and
advise her. She, who had long been on ill terms with,
and now dreaded the appearance of being governed by
her father, received the Ambassador and three letters
written with the King’s own hand, in the haughtiest
and most slighting manner. Lord Holderness was
recalled in anger. The Princess, equally unfit to
govern, or to be governed, threw herself into the arms
of France, by the management of one Dubacq, a little
Secretary, who had long been instilling advice into
her, to draw her husband from the influence of Monsieur
Bentinck and the Greffier, the known partizans
of England; the former of whom, immediately after
the death of the Prince, refused to admit Dubacq to a
Council, to which she had called him, with the chiefs
of the Republic, at the House in the Wood.</p>

<p>The Princess Royal was accomplished in languages,
painting, and particularly music; the Queen, and the
King too, before their rupture, had great opinion of
her understanding; but the pride of her race, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
violence of her passions<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> had left but a scanty sphere
for her judgment to exert itself.</p>

<p>November 14.&mdash;The Parliament met. Lord Coventry,
and Lord Willoughby, of Parham, moved the
Address in the House of Lords; Lord Downe and
Sir William Beauchamp Proctor in the Commons.
Sir John Cotton objected to the words <em>our flourishing
condition</em>; but that was the only breath of opposition.</p>

<p>On the 18th, there was a meeting at the Speaker’s,
to consult on punishing the Sheriffs for their insolent
behaviour on the delivery of Murray; but they came
to no resolution, except on remanding Murray to his
imprisonment. Accordingly, on the 20th, Lord Coke
moved to have the former votes on him read, and then
to revive them. He spoke well, and treated Murray
and the Sheriffs with great contempt. Lord Coke<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
had ready parts, a great memory, great Whig zeal.
There was too much pomp in his turn, and vehemence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>in the expression of his dislikes, which were chiefly
now directed against the Scotch, who had persecuted
him bitterly, on a quarrel with his wife, a daughter
of the late Duke of Argyle. He was on ill terms too
with Mr. Pelham, and had intended to have opened
on the neglect shown to the old Whigs; but his friend,
Lord Hartington, the officious tool to Mr. Pelham’s
ingratitude, had been with him that morning, and
persuaded him to drop so general an attack. Lord
Duplin seconded him. Sydenham opposed, and Lord
Egmont,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> who spoke with great caution, and apologized
for undertaking the cause, was against unnecessary
asperity; [he] said, “This man had demonstrated
the insufficiency of the power of the House; that
his imprisonment would not put a stop to pamphlets;
that the public, who cannot judge as the House
of Commons does, would think the whole an election
matter&mdash;a point in which they are most jealous; that
Murray had already suffered greatly; that to revive
the sentence would be inflicting banishment, which
will be no further voluntary, than as he will prefer it
to imprisonment. That the sentence must be renewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
every session; and that the Commons, though but a
third part of the Legislature, would be exerting the
power of banishment, which is unknown to the Crown
itself. That such a stretch of authority would be
doubly unpopular, after enacting a continuation of the
Parliament by the Regency Bill last session. That
in one point you had set yourselves a precedent of
moderation by slighting the second set of Queries,
after censuring the first, though the second attacked
both King and Parliament; the first only the Duke.
That contempt had stopped the progress of those
libels; that contempt such as Lord Coke’s would be
the properest treatment of Murray. That this prosecution
can’t be pursued without some injustice, as it
must be stopped somewhere, and it will be unjust not
to proceed as far hereafter on any election complaint:”
and then after a definition of true and false honour,
he moved to adjourn.</p>

<p>Lord Coke replied in few but masterly words;
defined true and false moderation, and said, “That
true moderation is becoming when the culprit submits,
but that it is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parvi animique pusilli</i> not to
persecute a criminal who plumes himself on his defiance,
and is the patron of a lost, fallen, unanimated
cause!” Mr. Pelham commended both speeches, and
added, “If the House has not all the authority it
wishes, it ought at least to exert all it has.” The
Motion for adjournment was rejected, and the resumption
of the sentence agreed to without a division.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Lord Coke then moved, that Murray should receive
the sentence on his knees; and that the pamphlet
called <em>his Case</em> might be read, which was unanimously
voted a false, scandalous, and seditious libel; and then
Lord Coke moved to address the King to order the
Attorney-General to prosecute the author, printer,
and publishers; adding, that he would not move any
censure on the Sheriffs, but hoped it would be a warning
to the City what Magistrates they choose. Sir
John Barnard was to have made their submission, if
any vote had been proposed against them.</p>

<p>The 22nd, Lord Barrington moved that the number
of seamen for the ensuing year should be increased
to ten thousand, and said archly, “That he did not
intend to defend the change of his own opinion, but
of those who ought to preserve a political steadiness
in their conduct; that he did not think so large a
number always necessary, but circumstances made
them so now.” The Bedfords and Sandwichs were
removed; the Pitts and the Lytteltons were to be
cajoled, and so ten thousand became necessary. They
were voted.</p>

<p>The 25th, Lord Coke moved to call the Serjeant-at-Arms,
who reported that Murray was absconded.
Lord Coke moved for a proclamation and reward for
apprehending him, which Vyner and Sydenham opposed,
and the latter made a speech worthy the ages
of fanaticism, comparing Murray to Prophet Daniel,
who would not kneel to Nebuchadnezzar’s Idol, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
alleged the example of the Dissenters, who do not
kneel at the Sacrament. Alderman Jansen defended
the City, on which Lord Coke had reflected, and
said, “That to have touched the Sheriffs would have
raised a tumult.” A reward of five hundred pounds
for apprehending Murray was voted on a division of
98 to 26.</p>

<p>The Duke had a fall as he was hunting at Windsor,
was taken up speechless, and refusing to be blooded,
grew dangerously ill with a pain in his side, and was
given over by the physicians; but recovered. The
King was inexpressibly alarmed, wept over him, and
told everybody that was in his confidence, that the
nation would be undone, left to nothing but a woman
and children! He said to Mr. Fox of the Duke,
“He has a head to guide, to rule, and to direct;”
and always talked as if the Duke was to be sole
Regent. Mr. Fox repeated this to him, who said, the
King had talked to him himself in the same strain.
“Why then, sir,” replied Mr. Fox, “don’t you just
put him in mind, in those fits of tenderness, of what
he has done to prevent your being so?” He replied,
“That it was now too late to remedy; that the
Regency Bill could not be repealed, and that even
if it could, he had rather bear the ignominy that had
been laid upon him, than venture giving the King
the uneasiness of reflecting, if it were but for two
hours in his own room, on the injury he had done
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Pelham was uneasy at Mr. Fox’s being admitted
to the Duke in his illness, when he was
excluded. The Duke asked Fox afterwards how the
brothers had behaved during that crisis. He
replied, “Both cried: the Duke of Newcastle over-acted
it, but Mr. Pelham seemed really concerned.”&mdash;“Ay,”
said the Duke, “I know they both cried; for
the Duke of Newcastle, he cried, because he had not
been in the morning to know how I did&mdash;but for
Mr. Pelham, he is such a fellow, that I can believe he
was in earnest!”</p>

<p>The 27th, Mr. Fox in the committee proposed the
same army as last year, <em>as there was no alteration of
circumstances</em>; Sir John Cotton to reduce it to fifteen
thousand; and was seconded by Northey, Beckford,
Prowse, Thornton, Norris, Bertie, and Robinson.
Cotton was answered by William Lyttelton; as Beckford
(who had wished that the Army had committed
outrages, in order to have the nation sensible of
the dangers from it) was by Dr. Lee, who, to
palliate the change of his style, was so injudicious as
to insist that the situation of affairs was highly altered
by the deaths of the Prince and the Prince of Orange,
and the birth of the Duke of Burgundy. Lord Egmont,
who found himself almost alone in opposition,
made a very artful speech; said, “He had hoped
to have heard some answer from the Ministry to Sir
John Cotton’s arguments; that for his own part, he
should be very gentle, as it was not a time to provoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
a power that nothing could resist, but should coolly
ask for an answer. He ridiculed Dr. Lee with great
delicacy and compliments; knew that he had <em>reason</em>
for what he did; and that he had <em>great views</em>, and
overlooked small ones, and that such principles would
justify little deviations. Yet if the dreaded event of
a possible minority should come to pass, it would
always be easy to call troops from Ireland, where, and
by the number of officers, you always have the root of
an Army. That to facilitate the assembly of one, the
Parliament will be sitting: that the Ministry ought to
affect to show the good disposition of Government, now
everything is so quiet; and that such a display of tenderness
to the subject would produce real security.
He made a strong panegyric on the King, but said
those good principles of his Majesty were prevented
from being exerted by his Ministers, who govern by
force in a reign that has given no pretence for it.
That if any one of them would act constitutionally, he
would support that man in spite of little reflections;
and would extend his hand in defence, where he had
never extended it, if once the Government would quit
this road of rigour. That the death of the Prince
of Orange could be no argument for maintaining so
large an Army; we cannot govern Holland; that indeed
were the Dutch strong, and in a more flourishing
situation, it might be a reason, when we might give
and receive mutual assistance. But for the pretence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
of the birth of a Duke of Burgundy, nothing could be
more ridiculous; no argument more absurd than the
birth of Foreign Princes; or than our increasing
our Army whenever there is an heir to the Crown of
France.”</p>

<p>He asked, “in what period of our history the Crown
had so much power? That in 1646, when the Army
had conquered King and Parliament, they voted but
6000 men necessary. Yet, treble as the present
Army is desired, he would offer a composition, which, if
accepted, he would vote for the present plan within
900 men: he would offer it to one (Mr. Pelham) not
used to negotiate in public; would make a treaty,
without one secret article; and would promise peace
for one year,&mdash;a term as long as any modern treaty is
likely to last. The condition was, that the Ministry
should consent to reduce the Cavalry, and omit the
Staff, which would create a saving of 143,000<em>l.</em> He
urged that the King had shown by a former reduction,
that, though he ought not to be without Guards and
marks of sovereignty, he despises show. That the
Grenadiers may still be kept up to attend on the
King’s person; but he wished to break the Guards
and the regiment of Blues. And he concluded with
saying, that though he had no hopes of delivering the
nation from the danger, yet he wished to rescue it
from the expense of the Army, which cost very near
as much as that immense one of the King of Prussia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Pelham replied in a very dull speech, “That
he had seen no force exerted by the Administration;
and attempted to defend Dr. Lee: that if the King
dies, you have already provided for the strength of the
Government: will you now weaken it? that, whenever
the Army has been much reduced, tumults have immediately
arisen. France may be tempted to disturb
you, without meaning to fix the Pretender here: that
she might even mean that; and that some who heard
him knew that there had been Jacobite meetings
within the last six months. That his fears from that
quarter made him always more earnest on the question
of the Army, than upon any other; and that he desired
no overt act to convince him of the still real
existence of Jacobitism. That the reduction proposed
was a poor pittance if meant for economy. That,
indeed, if it were worth while, the Blues might be
changed; he had not much objection to it, though they
had always had the title of Guards. That seventy
men are as much as one officer can command; that
the Army had already been reformed; a further reduction
would be useless or dangerous, and will be a
heavier burthen where quartered, from want of more
officers.” The House divided at five, and voted the
same Army by 180 to 43. Only Lord Middlesex and
Martyn, of the late Prince’s faction, voting with Lord
Egmont and the Speaker.</p>

<p>About this time, France seemed threatened with a
cloud of intestine troubles. Louis the <em>well-beloved</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
had outlived the flattery of even French subjects.
Verses,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> recommending the assassination of him, were
pasted up on the Louvre and the Pont-Neuf. Yet,
though marked for destruction by his priests, it was
with great difficulty that Madame de Pompadour, his
mistress, could divert the melancholy cast of his mind
from sinking into a habit of devotion. She perpetually
varied his pleasures, and carried him from
one palace and hunting seat to another,&mdash;journeys
which cost immense sums, and made the people join
in the clamour which the Clergy had conjured up.
Gunpowder and some treasonable papers were found
in the cradle of the Duke of Burgundy. The Dauphin,
a dull, bigoted Prince, was zealously attached
to his mother, and had hazarded brutalities to the
mistress, which the King bore with great indulgence.
It did not break out into factions, as the
domestic quarrels of the Royal Family had done for
two generations here in England, but appeared in
little marks and distinctions, such as different manners
of wearing the Cordon, &amp;c. among the creatures
of either Court. In the midst of these
uneasinesses, a new flame broke out. The Archbishop
of Paris was a favourite, having made his
court even at the expense of his brethren the clergy.
The hospitals had always been managed with so
much integrity as to become the most creditable
fund for charity; the Parliament directed them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
The Archbishop endeavoured to arrogate the sole
command of them to himself: the King supported
his pretensions. The Parliament having in vain
remonstrated, concurred to throw up their employments;
and though they submitted to resume their
functions, it was not without having inspired the
Court with a temper of moderation, which is as seldom
learnt by despotic Kings, as such firmness is
seldom practised by Parliaments renowned for far
greater liberties.</p>

<p>December 4th.&mdash;Mr. Pelham opened the Land Tax
of three shillings in the pound; and recommended as
his maxim <em>to preserve and improve our situation,
seldom to gain, and then our enemies will not be
offended</em>. Lord Harley and Beckford, with Vyner,
Oglethorpe, Robinson, Admiral Vernon, Sydenham,
Thornton, and Cooke, (the sad refuse of all the last
Oppositions,) opposed it. So did Sir John Barnard,
who said, “He had declared two years ago, that, if
the peace continued, he would vote no more for three
shillings; that the peace was made because our Allies
had not contributed equally to the expense of the
war; and he proposed a wild scheme of tying down
600,000<em>l.</em> a year, out of the Sinking Fund, to pay
the National Debt, by which means, in fifty years, we
should be able to carry on as extensive a war as ever
we ought to wage.” A scheme by which, if strictly
pursued, and a new war should intervene, we should
be paying off money borrowed at three per cent., while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
obliged to borrow other money at five, six, or whatever
interest extortion should find it a proper season
to demand. Lord Strange spoke for the question.
Sir John Cotton answered, “That country gentlemen
would indeed have very <em>little ease</em>,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> if three shillings
land tax was thought necessary till our debts were
paid, as Lord Strange had said, and nobody had contradicted.”
Mr. Pelham said, “Lands sell better
now than ever they had done, and that luxury and
election contests between neighbouring gentlemen occasion
the change of property.” Cotton replied, “The
country gentlemen had learnt from the report of the
Secret Committee, that the Court supports one side,
and therefore they would grow more wary.” They
divided for two shillings, but it was carried for three,
by 176 to 50.</p>

<p>The next day, on the report, Sydenham made a
lamentable speech, affected to cry, and asked pardon
for quoting a ludicrous epitaph on so melancholy an
occasion, but which he could not help thinking applicable
to the great Minister of these times, who has
so burthened land:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Lie heavy on him, Land; for he</p>
<p class="verse">Laid many a heavy load on thee.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The 10th, the Mutiny Bill was read in the Committee.
Lord Egmont made some faint opposition on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the old points; but not finding himself supported,
went away before the division, which was but 19 to
118. Sir Harry Erskine voted for the Bill, without
mentioning the clauses he had last year promised to
bring in.</p>

<p>Lord Halifax had stayed in the country out of
humour, having in vain demanded to be made a
Cabinet-Counsellor, as an introduction to the Regency,
and the Secretaryship for the West Indies. His friend,
Lord Barrington, was now sent to acquaint him that
the King persisted in a refusal, but might be brought
to acquiesce in more moderate demands. Lord Halifax
came to town, protesting he would resign, but was
pacified with a promise of the West Indies being in a
great measure subjected to the Board of Trade.</p>

<p>The 12th died Lord Bolingbroke;<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> a man who will
not be seen in less extraordinary lights by posterity
than he was by his contemporaries, though for very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
different reasons. His own age regarded him either as
the greatest statesman, oppressed by faction, and the
greatest genius persecuted by envy; or as the most
consummate villain, preserved by clemency, and the
most treacherous politician, abandoned by all parties
whom he had successively betrayed. Posterity will
look on him as the greatest philosopher from Pope’s
writings; or as an author of a bounded genius from
his own. To see him in a true light, they must
neither regard all the incense offered to him by Tories,
nor credit all the opprobrium cast on him by Whigs.
They must see him compounded of all those vices and
virtues that so often enter into the nature of a great
genius, who is not one of the greatest.</p>

<p>Was it being master of no talents to have acted
the second part, when little more than a youth, in
overturning such a Ministry, and stemming such a
tide of glory, as Lord Godolphin’s and the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Marlborough’s? Were there no abilities, after his
return from banishment, in holding such a power as
Sir Robert Walpole’s at bay for so many years, even
when excluded from the favourable opportunity of
exerting his eloquence in either House of Parliament?
Was there no triumph in having chiefly contributed
to the fall of that Minister? Was there no glory in
directing the councils and operations of such men as Sir
William Windham, Lord Bath, and Lord Granville?
And was there no art in persuading the self-fondest
and greatest of poets, that the writer of the Craftsman
was a more exalted genius than the author of the
Dunciad? Has he shown no address in palliating the
exploded treaty of Utrecht? Has he not, in his
letters<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> on that event, contrived to make assertions
and hypothesis almost balance stubborn facts?<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> To
cover his own guilt, has he not diverted our attention
towards pity for the great enemy, in whose service he
betrayed his own country?</p>

<p>On the other hand, what infamy to have sold the
conqueror to the conquered! What ingratitude in
labouring the ruin of a Minister, who had repealed
his sentence of banishment! What repeated treasons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>to the Queen, whom he served; to the Pretender,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
who had received and countenanced him; to the late
King, who had recalled him! What ineffectual arts
to acquire the confidence of the late King, by means
of the Duchess of Kendal, and of the present King,
by Lady Suffolk! What unwearied ambition, even
at seventy years of age, in laying a plan of future
power<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> in the favour of the Prince of Wales! What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
deficiency in the very parts that had given success to
the Opposition, to have left him alone excluded from
reaping the harvest of so many labours! What
blackness in disclosing the dirtiness of Pope,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
had deified him! And what philosophy was that
which had been initiated in the ruin of the Catalans;
had employed its meridian in labouring the restoration
of Popery and arbitrary power; and busied the
end of its career, first in planning factions in the
Pretender’s Court, by the scheme of the father’s
resigning his claim to the son; and then in sowing
the seeds of division between a King and a Prince,
who had pardoned all his treasons!</p>

<p>Sir Robert Walpole and Lord Bolingbroke had set
out rivals at school, lived a life of competition,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and
died much in the same manner, provoked at being
killed by empirics;<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> but with the same difference in
their manner of dying as had appeared in the temper
of their lives: the first with a calmness that was
habitual philosophy; the other with a rage that his
affected philosophy could not disguise. The one
had seen his early ambition dashed with imprisonment,
from which he had shot into the sphere of his
rival, who was exiled, sentenced, recalled; while
Walpole rose gradually to the height of temperate
power, maintained it by the force of his single talents
against Bolingbroke, assisted by all the considerable
geniuses of England; and when driven from it at
last, resigned it without a stain or a censure, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>retired to a private life, without an attempt to re-establish
himself&mdash;almost without a regret for what
he had lost. The other, unquiet, unsteady, shocked to
owe his return to his enemy, more shocked to find his
return was not to power, incapable of tasting the retirement
which he made delightful to all who partook
it, died at last with the mortification of owing his
greatest reputation to the studies he had cultivated
to distress his antagonist. Both were beloved in
private life; Sir Robert from the humanity and
frankness of his nature; Bolingbroke from his politeness
of turn and elegance of understanding. Both were
fond of women; Walpole with little delicacy; Bolingbroke
to enjoy the delicacy of pleasure. Both were
extravagant; and the Patriot who accused, and the
Minister who had been accused of rapine, died poor
or in debt. Walpole was more amiable in his virtues;
Bolingbroke more agreeable in his vices.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>Cresset was made Treasurer to the Prince of Wales,
in the room of Mr. Selwyn, who died. Nich. Herbert
succeeded him as Treasurer, and Mr. Harding as
Auditor to Princess Emily, who had wished to give
those places to William Leveson, Lord Gower’s
brother, but attached to the Duke of Bedford.
Mr. Leveson applied to Mr. Pelham, who insisted
on his asking Lord Gower’s interest, which he refused
to do. Oswald, who, by the consent of Pitt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the faction of cousins, was to have kissed hands for
Clerk of the Green Cloth to the Prince of Wales, but
two days before the Prince’s death, was now made
a Lord of Trade.</p>

<p>About the middle of this month, died his Majesty’s
youngest daughter, the Queen of Denmark, a Princess
of great spirit and sense, and in the flower of her age.
Her death, which was terrible, and after an operation
which lasted an hour, resembled her mother’s&mdash;a
slight rupture which she concealed, and had been
occasioned by stooping when she was seven months
gone with her first child. The Queen had in a
manner prophesied to her when she was expiring
herself: “Louisa, remember I die by being giddy,
and obstinate in having kept my disorder a secret!”
Her fate, too, had borne a resemblance to her mother’s;
for the King of Denmark, though passionately fond
of her, to prevent the appearance of being governed,
had kept a mistress, and given her great uneasiness:
yet she never mentioned it in her confidential letters
to her own family. The Duke said, she had always
told them, that if she was unhappy, they should never
know it. In her last moments, she wrote a moving
letter to the King, the Duke, and her sisters, to take
leave of them. This letter, and the similitude of
hers and her mother’s death, struck the King in the
sharpest manner, and made him break out into warm
expressions of passion and tenderness. He said,
“This has been a fatal year to my family! I lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
my eldest son&mdash;but I am glad of it;&mdash;then the Prince
of Orange died, and left everything in confusion.
Poor little Edward has been cut open (for an imposthume
in his side), and now the Queen of Denmark
is gone! I know I did not love my children when
they were young; I hated to have them running into
my room; but now I love them as well as most
fathers.”</p>

<p>The 19th.&mdash;The Parliament adjourned; an era
for ever remarkable in English annals! Opposition,
which had lasted from the days of Queen Elizabeth,
and even the distinctions of parties having in a
manner ceased at this period! Popery, which had
harassed the reign of that heroine; the spirit of
liberty which had struggled against four Stuarts; the
spirit of slavery which had wrestled to restore their
descendants; all the factions which had distracted
King William, possessed Queen Anne, and ridiculed
the House of Hanover; and the Babel of parties that
had united to demolish Walpole, and separated again
to pursue their private interests; all were now sunk
into a dull mercenary subjection to two brothers,
whose administration resembled that of King James
for timidity, of King William for change of Ministers,
and of Queen Anne for an ignominious peace! Buckingham
had been attacked in the arms of King James;
Laud and Strafford beheaded; Hyde banished, though
allied to the Crown; the virtuous Somers impeached;
the victorious Marlborough disgraced; the favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Walpole removed. Pelham alone could teach servility
to a Parliament, whose privileges were yet untouched!</p>

<p>In Sweden there seems the same indifference for
liberty. Count Tessin, the pattern of the British
Minister, always affecting to resign, always entreated
by his creatures to retain his power, is known to be
meditating the restoration of absolute power. In
France, where the Crown is despotic, and the people
bigoted to whatever phantom is their King, there
is a set of men, whose remonstrances, steadiness, and
patriotism would figure with any senate, that Greece,
Rome, or former Britain knew. But it is time to
conclude the history of this extraordinary year, all
the chief events of which having terminated in confirming
the power of Mr. Pelham, it will be proper,
before I take leave of the reader, to add this person’s
portrait to those of the under-actors; and the better
to illustrate it, I shall take the liberty of examining
his and his master Sir Robert Walpole’s characters
together, though it is difficult to compare two Ministers,
when on one side genius must be entirely
left out of the question: nor could anything draw on
a parallel between a man of genius and a man of
none, but the singular case of the latter having
affected what the former could not&mdash;I mean power
without unpopularity.</p>

<p>When Elijah was hurried to heaven, he left his
cloak to Elisha with a <em>double</em> portion of his spirit:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
but that legacy<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> in no sense happened to Mr. Pelham,
who was as much inferior to Sir Robert Walpole in
political courage as in abilities. Sir Robert Walpole
was bold, open, steady, never dejected; he would
attempt for honest ends where strict morality did not
countenance his opinion; he always disclosed his arts
after they had effected his purpose; and sometimes
defeated them by too early discovery. He never gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
up his party to serve himself, though he has departed
from his own opinion to please his friends,
who were serving themselves; nor did he ever lose
his cheerfulness, though he had hurt himself against
his opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham was timorous, reserved, fickle, apt to
despair. He would often not attempt when he was
convinced it would be right; would sooner hurt himself
by not telling his mind, than attain his aim by
being communicative; and often gave up his party,
indeed not to serve himself, but his enemies, and
frequently disappointed himself of success, by never
expecting to succeed. Presumption made Sir Robert
Walpole many enemies; want of confidence in himself
kept from Mr. Pelham many friends. Sir Robert
Walpole was content to have one great honest view,
and would overlook or trample upon the intermediate
degrees. Mr. Pelham could never reach a great view,
by stumbling at little ones; he would scruple to give
an hundred pound to one opponent, and to buy off
another would give up a question<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> that might endanger
the nation. Sir Robert Walpole loved power
so much, that he would not endure a rival; Mr.
Pelham loved it so well, that he would endure anything.
The one would risk his administration, by
driving every considerable man from Court, rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
venture their being well there; the other would employ
any means to take able men out of the Opposition,
though he ventured their engrossing his authority and
outshining his capacity; but he dreaded abuse more
than competition, and always bought off his enemies
to avoid their satire, rather than to acquire their support:
whereas, Sir Robert Walpole never trading but
for members, and despising invectives, and dreading
rivals, gained but weak, uncertain assistance, and
always kept up a formidable Opposition. His apprehension
of competitors was founded on prudence, because
great part of his authority depended upon the
King’s favour: Mr. Pelham owing nothing to that,
had the less reason to fear losing it; as he maintained
himself in the Ministry in spite of the King’s
partiality to abler men, he had no reason to be
jealous of their getting interest at Court.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Walpole raised himself to the head of
the Administration, without interest, without fortune,
without alliances, and in defiance of the chiefs of his
own party:<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> he rose by the House of Commons&mdash;he
fell by it. Mr. Pelham found himself next upon the
list, and was recommended to a strong party by their
leader. He would never have risen, had he had no
other foundation than the House of Commons, and
would fall to-morrow if he had no other support; for
he must be undone whenever his safety depends upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
himself. Sir Robert Walpole’s eloquence was made
for use, and he never could shine but when it was
necessary<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> he should. He wanted art when he had no
occasion for it; and never pleased, but when he did
more than please. I am not going to contrast this
part of their characters, nor to say that Mr. Pelham
only shone upon trifling and unnecessary occasions,
for he did not do even that; he was obscure upon the
most trivial occurrences, perplexed even when he had
but one idea, and whenever he spoke well, it was
owing to his being heated; he must lose his temper
before he could exert his reason. Sir Robert Walpole
palliated too little, Mr. Pelham too much. The one
would defend his errors by a majority; the other with
a greater majority would excuse his merit, and would
sooner obscure and depreciate his meaning when right
and clear of itself, than not apologize for it. Sir
Robert Walpole could not deviate but with openness
and sincerity; the other degraded truth by timidity,
sense by mystery, and right by asking pardon for it.</p>

<p>The one was honoured by his enemies, the other at
best pitied by his friends. His most prejudiced opponents<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
often grew convinced that the former was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>the right: the heartiest friends of the latter knew he
meant to be so, but never found stronger reasons to
confirm them in their opinion. The one durst do
right and durst do wrong too; the other dared either
so little, that it generally ended in his doing the latter.
Sir Robert Walpole never professed honesty, but followed
it; Mr. Pelham always professed it, and kept
his word, when nothing happened to make him break
it; and then he broke it for some other honest end,
though perhaps far from being equally cogent.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Walpole’s mastery was understanding
his own country, and his foible, inattention to every
other country, by which it was impossible he could
thoroughly understand his own. Mr. Pelham understood
more of his own country than of others, though
he would have made a better Minister for any other
nation; for as he would not have met with opposition
or contradiction, two things his nature could not bear,
and as he meant exceedingly well, he would have
served the country that employed him to the best of
his understanding, and that might have cleared up as
well as his temper, when he had nothing to perplex it.
In the knowledge of the Revenue, he and all other
men must yield to Sir R. Walpole, though he and all
other men make the same use of that knowledge,
which is to find new funds for the necessities of the
Government, and for the occasions of the Administration:
by those occasions, I mean corruption, in which
I believe Mr. Pelham would never have wet his finger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
if Sir Robert Walpole had not dipped up to the
elbow; but as he did dip, and as Mr. Pelham was
persuaded that it was as necessary for him to be
Minister as it was for Sir Robert Walpole, he plunged
as deep. The difference was, that Mr. Pelham always
bribed more largely as he had more power; for whenever
it tottered, he the less ventured to prop it by
those means, as he was the more afraid of being called
to account for putting them in practice.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Walpole, with the greatest confidence of
himself, had no pride; Mr. Pelham had the most, with
the least self-sufficience. Both were loved in private
life. Sir Robert Walpole loved magnificence, and was
generous to a fault: the other had neither ostentation
nor avarice, and yet had little generosity. The one
was profuse to his family and his friends, liberal indiscriminately,
unbounded to his tools and spies: the
other loved his family and his friends, and enriched
them as often as he could steal an opportunity from
his extravagant bounty to his enemies and antagonists.
Indifferent people were too indifferent to him; and for
intelligence, it was one of the greatest blemishes of his
Administration, he wanted it so entirely&mdash;not resolution
more! Sir Robert Walpole’s friendships were
chiefly confined to persons much below him; Mr. Pelham’s
were almost all founded on birth and rank: the
one was too familiar, the other never so. Sir Robert
Walpole was forgiving to a fault, if forgiveness can
be faulty; Mr. Pelham never forgave, but when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
durst not resent. Sir Robert Walpole met with much
ingratitude; Mr. Pelham was guilty of much. Both
were frequently betrayed: Sir Robert Walpole without
being deceived; Mr. Pelham not half so often as
he suspected it. The one was most depreciated while
he was Minister; the other will be most when he
ceases to be Minister. All men thought Mr. Pelham
honest till he was in power; the other never was
thought so till he was out.</p>

<p>Both were fortunate in themselves, unhappy in
their brothers. With unbounded thirst for politics,
the Duke of Newcastle and Horace Walpole were
wretched politicians: each inferior to their brothers
in everything laudable; each assuming and jealous of
their own credit, though [neither] the Duke nor
Horace could ever have been considerable, but by the
fortune of their brothers. The one childish and extravagant,
the other a buffoon and avaricious; Horace
sunk into contempt when his brother fell with honour;
the Duke was often on the point of dragging his
brother down, and was the object of all contempt,
even where his brother had still power and honour.
Mr. Pelham maintained his inferiority to Sir Robert
Walpole even in the worthlessness of his brother.</p>

the Duke of Devonshire (Lord Hartington in the text), at the
Spa in Germany, which brought advice that his Grace was
much better, and that there were great hopes of his recovery;
but these agreeable hopes were soon damped by the arrival of
Lord John Cavendish, the Duke’s youngest brother, at seven
o’clock the same night, at Devonshire House, who brought the
melancholy news, that his Grace had relapsed, and departed this
life the 3rd instant, at half an hour past nine o’clock at night, at
the above place.
</p>
<p>
His Grace was eldest son of William, late Duke of Devonshire,
by his Duchess Catherine, daughter and sole heir of John
Hoskins, Esq. In March, 1748, he married the Lady Charlotte
Boyle, youngest daughter and heiress of Richard, late Earl
of Burlington, which lady died in December, 1754, by whom he
had issue,&mdash;1, William, Marquis of Hartington, born in December,
1748, who is now the fifth Duke of Devonshire, a minor, at
Harrow school; 2, Lord Richard, born June 19, 1752; 3, Lord
George Henry, born in March, 1754; and 4, Lady Dorothy,
born August 27, 1750.
</p>
<p>
His Grace, at the time of his decease, was Lord High Treasurer,
and a Privy Counsellor of Ireland, Governor of the county
of Cork in that kingdom; a Governor of the Charter-house,
Fellow of the Royal Society, and Knight of the Garter; but
some time since had resigned all his places on the British establishment.
The many amiable and truly excellent public and
private virtues, and the very shining accomplishments which his
Grace possessed, added a lustre to his high rank, and render his
death a public loss.&mdash;(Public Journals.)</p></div>

State to Queen Anne, had, on the accession of George the
First, been impeached for his share in the treaty of Utrecht, and
fled. Sir Robert Walpole (strongly against the inclination of
his brother Horace, Lord Townshend, and others of his friends)
obtained his pardon, though Lord Bolingbroke and his advocates
afterwards pretended that the Minister had no hand in it. The
day after his return he dined at Chelsea, to thank Sir Robert;
but his confusion and uneasiness were so great, that he had
like to have been choked with the first bit he ate, and was forced
to rise from table. He soon endeavoured to supplant Sir Robert,
by the assistance of his enemy the Duchess of Kendal, who
obtained an audience for him in the late King’s closet, where he
presented a representation against Sir Robert, which the King
immediately afterwards delivered to Sir Robert, and repeated
the conversation to him. A parallel case happened afterwards
to the same Minister. Lord Stair endeavoured to supplant him
with Queen Caroline, and even was so hardy as to make love to
her, which not succeeding, he wrote a long letter to her, and
went the next morning for an answer. She sent him out word
by her Chamberlain, Lord Grantham, that she had given his
letter to Sir Robert Walpole, and had ordered him to deliver
her answer. Lord Stair saw his situation, and set out next
morning for Scotland.</p></div>

gave the Prince a scheme for vesting the Revenue in the
Crown for every six years, without a Civil List, and for having
Parliaments holden every five or six years. The Court he paid
to the Prince was to a degree of adoration. One day that he
dined with Lord Egmont, the Prince came in as they were
drinking coffee, and bad them not mind him. Lord Egmont,
who knew that to obey was to respect, gave Lord Bolingbroke a
dish; but he, who thought that to disobey from respect was more
respectful (and who perhaps knew, that though the Prince
seemed to encourage familiarity, he never forgave it), started
and cried, “Good God! my Lord, what are you doing? Do
you consider who is present?” One of his views was to be an
Earl; and, knowing that the Prince had had an inclination for
his sister, Lady St. John, he took her son into his own house,
under pretence of educating him and making him his heir, as an
inducement to the Prince to promise him the Earldom. The
Prince often sent his first Minister, Dr. Lee, to him; and one
day said to Lord Egmont of Lord Bolingbroke, “That man is at
fourscore just what he was at forty! I know how he flatters
Lee to his face, and yet he is always teasing me to discard him,
and telling him that he is not fit to hold a candle to an Administration.”
</p>
<p>
A few years after this note was written, I met with the following
words in the eleventh letter of the Dissertation on Parties,
p. 151, of the quarto edition: “Should a King obtain, for many
years at once, the supplies and powers which used to be granted
annually to him, this would be deemed, I presume, even in the
present age, an unjustifiable measure, and an <em>intolerable grievance</em>;
for this plain reason, because it would alter our constitution
in the fundamental article, that requires frequent assemblies
of the whole legislature, in order to assist, and control too, the
executive power, which is entrusted with one part of it.” What
must be the heart of that man, who, merely to load an envied
Minister, could suppose instances of wicked administration,
which had not entered into the head of any other man; and who
could afterwards adopt those suppositions himself, and try to
recommend himself to a Prince by those individual bad measures,
the creatures of his own brain: and this at past seventy
years old! hazarding, for a very few years of unenjoyable power,
to entail so calamitous a system on his country!</p></div>

<p>I sit down to resume a task, for which I fear posterity
will condemn the author, at the same time that
they feel their curiosity gratified. On reviewing the
first part of these Memoirs, I find the truth rigidly told.
And even since they were written, I have often been
struck with the censures which are passed on such historians
as have fairly displayed the faulty sides of the
characters they exhibit. Theopompus is called a satirist:
Timæus was so severe,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> as to be nicknamed Epitimæus,
the Blamer. Some of our own annalists, as Wilson,
Weldon, Osborn, (though frequently quoted,) are
seldom mentioned without reproach. I defend them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
not: if their representations are exaggerated, they not
only deserve reproach, but discredit.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I examined the candid authors.
Two of our own, who deal wonderfully in panegyric,
Clarendon and Echard, I find to have dispensed
invectives with a liberal hand on men of parties
opposite to their own&mdash;does then the province of
praise and censure depend on the felicity of choosing
one’s party? <em>That</em> shall never influence me&mdash;I
would as soon wish to be rejected for flattering one
party, as for blaming another. Nor can I, on the
strictest consideration, determine to write like biographers
and authors of Peerages and Compendiums,
who sink all executions in a family, all blots in a
’scutcheon, and lay out their personages as fair as if
they wrote epitaphs, not history. Does any noble
family extinguish? One should grieve, on reading
their genealogies, that such a succession of heroes,
statesmen, patriots, should ever fail; if a little knowledge
of mankind did not call forth the blemishes,
which these varnishers have slubbered over. If I
write, I must write facts. The times I describe have
neither been glorious nor fortunate. Have our affairs
gone ill, and yet were our Governors wise? Have
Parliaments been venal, servile, and yet individuals
upright? If I paint the battle of Dettingen in
prosperous colours, am I an admired historian? If I
mention hostages sent to France, am I an abusive
one? Are there no shades, no degrees of vices and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
misconduct? Must no Princes be blamed, till they
are Neros? Must Vespasian’s avarice pass unnoticed,
because he did not set fire to the city&mdash;because he did
not burn the means of gratifying his exactions?</p>

<p>Suppose I were to comply with this indulgent
taste, and write thus:&mdash;George the Second was the
most glorious Monarch that ever sat on the English
Throne; his victories over the united arms of Spain
and France<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> will illustrate our annals till time is no
more; and his condescension and generosity will conspire
to raise his private character to a level with his
public. The Duke of Newcastle was a prodigy of
sincerity, steadiness, and abilities. Mr. Pelham was
the humblest man, the bravest Minister, the heartiest
friend, the openest enemy. The Earl of Holderness
the most graceful dancer that ever trod the stage of
business since the days of Chancellor Hatton&mdash;avaunt,
Flattery! tell the truth, my pen!</p>

<p>The miscarriage of the Rebellion had silenced
Jacobitism; the death of the Prince of Wales had
quashed opposition; and the removal of the Duke of
Bedford and Lord Sandwich had put an end to factions
in the Ministry. The ascendant of the Pelhams drew
the attention of the disaffected, who began to see a
prospect of the restoration, if not of the Stuarts, at
least of absolute power; and this union was not a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
cemented by the harmony of hatred, in which both
the Pelhams and the Jacobites concurred against the
Duke and the Duke of Bedford; neither the one nor
the other were disposed at this juncture to stem the
torrent. The Duke was determined not to give the
Pelhams so fair an opportunity of mischief, as by
setting up the standard of opposition during his
father’s life; and the treasures which he expected at
the King’s death, and would not risk losing,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> he
knew would indemnify the delay of his revenge. The
Duke of Bedford, who had been driven into contention,
not sought it himself, did not feel resentment
enough for the loss of power, which he had never much
coveted, to make him eager in returning ill-usage;
and as he thought himself distinguished by the King’s
esteem, he affected gratitude to the Master, more
than revenge to the Ministers. Pitt and his little
faction were rather unsatisfied, than in possession of
any title to complaint; and yet from that quarter
seemed to lower the first small cloud that might at all
obscure the present halcyon season.</p>

<p>A new subsidiary treaty with Saxony (a strange
codicil to a general peace!) had been lately concluded;
the pretence, the purchase of another Electoral vote
for the Archduke Joseph, whom we persisted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
making a candidate for the succession of the Empire,
though his father and his mother were equally averse
to see him King of the Romans. As he was immediate
heir to his mother’s vast dominions, the Emperor
could not but foresee, that, if the estates of the House
of Austria fell to his son, it might even become difficult
for himself to retain the empty diadem, when the
means of grandeur should be devolved on his child;
and the Empress-queen, who had not ceded a jot of
power to a husband whose person she loved, was not
desirous of calling her son Emperor, who might be
less tractable, and more impatient to reign in earnest.
Yet the dread the King felt of a new war in Germany,
his jealousy of his nephew of Prussia, and even the
favourite impulse of acting in contradiction to him,
made his Majesty eager to hurry on the election, and
profuse of subsidies, which were not to be issued from
his own coffers. Lord Cobham, who, having no place
to forfeit, was always used by Pitt as the trumpet of
their discontents, openly sounded his disapprobation
of the Treaty: and old Horace Walpole, who had
waded through, and transacted so many treaties,
without attaining a Peerage, was at last determined to
try if he could not traverse negotiations to better
purpose than he had negotiated.</p>

<p>On January 7th, the Parliament met again after
the adjournment; and on the 16th, Mr. Pelham laid
the Treaty before the House. The Duke of Bedford
came to town on the 15th; so far from meditating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
opposition, that he was resolved to make use of the
remains of the King’s favour, to ask a pension for the
Duchess’s sister, Lady Elizabeth Waldegrave. The
Duchess, who could not bear to be out of favour as
well as out of power, and who always kept a reconciliation
in view, had planned this suit, with at least
as much prospect to tie down the Duke by an obligation
to the King, from reverting to Opposition, as from
kindness to her sister; and there was no doubt but the
Pelhams would have pressed the King to grant so
trifling a boon; for what could they wish more, when
they had driven the Duke of Bedford to resign the
power of serving all his friends, than to silence his
murmurs, by serving the first friend of his for whom
he should submit to solicit?</p>

<p>The prospect of allies in Opposition was immediately
hung out to the Duke of Bedford, by some<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> who
wished to fix him against the Court, and who wanted
to engage him to speak against the Treaty, which they
knew would either prevent him from soliciting the
pension, or by touching so tender a point as a German
subsidy, would provoke the King to refuse his request.
This train caught effectually; and though the Duchess
was alarmed, yet not having time to work back her
husband, whose warmth was most impetuous, the
Duke determined at once to oppose the Saxon Treaty.</p>

<p>22nd, Mr. Pelham opened the Treaty in the Committee.
Old Horace Walpole spoke against it in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
manner that showed how well he knew where the
weakness of such treaties lay; and however astonishing
such arguments were when coming from him, they
were pressed with such force and weight as stilled
their ridicule, had he not himself done justice upon
himself, and concluded his oration with professing such
duty to the King, that, though so averse to the Treaty,
he should yet vote for it. The House burst into
laughter at such absurd pretence for zeal, which could
conquer its own conscience, but had not prevented him
from exposing the measures of a Prince, for whom he
expressed such veneration! Murray, Potter, Sir
Harry Erskine, Sir Thomas Robinson, Sir William
Yonge, Lord Hilsborough, Mr. Fox, Sir Peter Warren,
Mr. Legge, and Charles Townshend, spoke for; Sir
Walter Blacket, Beckford, Lord Strange, and Lord
Cobham against it; but it was agreed to by 236
to 54.</p>

<p>On the 23rd it was reported to the House. Northey
and George Haldane opposed it again. Nugent
was zealous for it. Sydenham, reflecting on Nugent’s
former religion, said, that he seemed not content with
a majority of electors, but would have an Emperor
chosen, <em>like a Pope</em>, by two-thirds. Vyner reflected
on the King for bringing such expenses on the nation,
after such obligations to it, and such noble provision
made for his children. This Mr. Pelham answered
finely, seriously, and pathetically; a manner in which
he particularly shone. There was no division.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 28th the Treaty was debated in the House
of Lords. The Duke of Bedford opened the opposition
to it, with professing, that his greatest difficulty
lay in its having been the act of the King, so good a
King, whom he had served seven years, and to whom
he was agitated with the fear of being misrepresented:
yet, that he could neither in conscience acquiesce, nor
be content with silently opposing subsidiary treaties in
time of peace; and the dangerous measures of wasting,
when we ought to be saving. That if you treat after
a war, you may obtain conditions certain; but what
advantages can you make, where there is nothing to
be given up or restored? That by paying for votes
for the Archduke, we are purchasing advantages for
our Allies, instead of for ourselves; and at the same
time instruct those Princes who take our money,
never to unite with us but for money. That with the
people it must be a measure most unpopular, to tax
them for money to be sent abroad, when they cannot
possibly discern how it touches their own interest.
And that in no shape the measure can be right, but
when a war is approaching; whereas, we are but just
emerged out of one. That the preamble is most injurious
to the dignity of our Crown; it speaks us
suppliants to that inconsiderable Prince, the King of
Poland, who is most incapable to serve us, not only
from the situation of his country, but from his bad
administration. Besides, he might have been obliged
to join us by the two Imperial Courts, as his ruling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
passion is to make Poland hereditary in his family&mdash;how
great then is his condescension, if he will not
take part against you! If he did, it would be of
little consequence: it is only giving so much for levy-money.
If England were attacked, of what use would
Saxons be? That he did not think this country or
Holland should always have such preparatory connexions
on the Continent; and yet that this Treaty did
not even stipulate that his Polish Majesty shall increase
his forces. That the fifth Article was wretchedly drawn!
and for that King’s vote&mdash;had it been secured, when
it might have been&mdash;that Cologne had been lost for
want of proper words to tie him down: a fit example
to have made us more wary! and yet how many
evasions open, if this Saxon Prince is disposed to
elude his engagements! That we are not likely to
bring about this election; and that we even keep off
two of the electors, by showing them that they may
ask a price for their votes. That Prussia’s protesting
against the election is a new doctrine&mdash;and as
new is this opportunity for Lords who love subsidizing!
Notify your intentions, you may have thirty or forty
of the College of Princes, who will take your money.
Yet, while we are thus bounteous, Russia takes no
steps, Austria few. But he supposed he should be
told, that Holland is to pay part; he was sorry for it;
Holland is still less able than we to be thus extravagant.
But if Holland should not pay, who is to make
good the deficiencies? If this is done with the consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of France, she only will have the merit: if without
her consent, it will bring on a war.</p>

<p>He then turned to home considerations, and (as
this was supposed to be a sacrifice offered by the
Duke of Newcastle to the King’s German passions,
contrary to the inclination of Mr. Pelham), he said
it was extravagant imbecility, if this measure was
yielded to by the Minister against his will. That the
tenour was throughout the same, and parsimony or
profusion took their turns, as individuals took prepossessions.
That to please individuals,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> the material
service, the Navy, had been reduced to 8000 seamen:
that to please individuals,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Nova Scotia had been profusely
suckled, and its deficiences always supplied.
That the land-tax, the malt-tax, the reduction of
interest, had been carried on with spirit: yet for what
have the public creditors been taxed, if the savings
made at their expense are scandalously lavished? If
measures are not changed, if men are not changed,
we must go on <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de mal en pire</i>. That when we pretend
to economy, how judiciously is it exerted! It is
displayed in contracting the rewards for removing the
mortality of the cattle, or for discovering highwaymen!
That our youngest daughter, Nova Scotia, is
favoured, while Jamaica is neglected, by an Administration
who neither grant protection to commerce, nor
endeavour at any reformation of morals. The Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>concluded with a Motion for an Address, to represent
that subsidiary treaties ought never to be concluded
in time of peace, especially after a long war, and that
they are neither necessary at present, nor likely to
procure any real advantage.</p>

<p>The Duke of Newcastle replied in a wild, incoherent,
incomprehensible speech of an hour and a quarter,
in which he set out with saying, that he would not
answer general heads, because the Duke of Bedford
had descended to particulars; and yet the greatest
deduction of his defence was an account of the three
last wars. That for this, it was a measure of peace
and economy, and that <em>it is little as it is, because it
is so great</em>. That he remembered the argument used
to blacken the great war was, that we have no interest
on the Continent; and that the Dutch were reproached
then, and are now. That he that is not for us, is
against us: that there are those who would gladly
accept the union of the Dutch. That if he thought
this a greater burthen than England could bear, in
proportion to the objections, he should be against it;
but that if it prevents a war, the sooner England concludes
this Treaty the better. That if we do not
connect with the Continent, we shall be obliged to
enter into the next, as we were into the last war.
What was the occasion of the three last wars? Of
the first, the succession to the Crown of Spain&mdash;<em>but
that can never happen again</em>. Everybody knows
the zeal of the present King of Spain. In the second,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the war occasioned by the vacancy of the Throne of
Poland, England took no part: if we had, it would
have prevented the last; at least, it would have been
better carried on. The last war was occasioned by
the ambition of Bavaria. <em>It cost us much, yet glad
he was, for we should have been in a worse condition,
if we had not entered into it.</em> From the Treaty
of Utrecht to that of Aix-la-Chapelle, there have been
no four years without greater expenses than these
four last. If the last war was occasioned by the
vacancy of the Imperial Throne, the treaty in question
is calculated to prevent such a vacancy and such consequences.
That Holland, he hoped, would emerge
out of her difficulties <em>by the prudence of the present
conjuncture</em>&mdash;that his meaning was sufficiently explained,
though it might be more elegantly; that more
plainly, would be improper. That we have received
the strongest assurances&mdash;what they are: if there
should be any Motion for laying them before the
House, he would be the first to oppose it. Have
we never seen Saxony act against its interest? If
any means had been omitted for engaging that
Power in the common cause, the Ministry would
have much to answer for. That the question of the
necessity of the unanimity of the electors had been
fully considered, <em>though there was a time when no
elector would have opposed</em>. That the election had
not hitherto proceeded, because Cologne did not understand
itself obliged to concur. That we must get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
six votes, and therefore, whatever is demanded, must
be granted, though Cologne did ask more, and it was
not granted. All arts were tried to engage that
elector without a subsidy. He then proved that the
election might have been carried and been valid with
a majority, and yet that we waited till we could
secure two-thirds. That he was told we meddled
everywhere; an accusation he was sometimes surprised
to hear from some people. That the Fleet had
repaired the miscarriages of the Army&mdash;was it not the
duty of economic Ministers to supply the Sea Service?
That for what had been hinted of the provocation we
should give to France, <em>the wisdom of that Power
will admire us, not be angry, if we do nothing to
hurt her</em>.</p>

<p>This, and some few preceding harangues of this
extraordinary person, I give merely as a specimen of
the rhetoric of a man, who certainly did not govern
his country by his oratoric abilities. The reader must
excuse me, if for the future I omit them, unless on
very particular occasions; for though I have generally
given myself the trouble to minute them down at the
delivery, it were too impertinent to commit them to
history. And I must beg so much indulgence, as
when argument, or connexion, or grammar is observably
wanting, that it may be remarked that at least
in all other speeches I have taken care to write true
English: in those of the Duke of Newcastle, the original
has been faithfully copied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Sandwich then, with most ungraceful delivery,
which yet was as powerful as the matter of his
speech, lamented his misfortune of differing with his
friend the Duke of Bedford, which he must do, though
he found the reasons preponderate very little on the
side of the Treaty, and though he agreed with his
Grace in near half he had said: that he considered
how little regard was paid to economy, and that nobody
was less prepossessed in favour of the Ministry,
whom he should gladly oppose, but where the exigencies
of the public required his concurrence. That he
knew their sentiments were to silence opposition at
any rate; that influenced by that motive, they had last
year reduced the Navy: however, he must own that
the event had justified the reduction; that he should
not concur now, if he did not hope that granting this
subsidy would stop greater profusion. And, that the
public might at least have this security even from the
badness of the present Ministers, that they will even
wave their own bad purposes, rather than hear disagreeable
truths; which, for his part, he should always
be ready to utter, though he did not approve being
actuated by private connexions in public affairs.</p>

<p>The secret of this speech was, that the Duke of
Bedford having acquainted Lord Sandwich with his
intention of opposing the Treaty, and having desired
him to consult the Duke, the latter had approved the
opposition, but would not openly concur, for fear of
offending the King; and as Lord Sandwich was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
known creature of the Duke, it was thought proper
that he should act this middle part, of voting for the
Treaty, and censuring the Pelhams. The Duke went
so far as to tell the King, that the Duke of Bedford
spoke just better than the Duke of Newcastle, but
that Lord Sandwich alone shone. The truth was,
Lord Sandwich ruined his little remains of character
for abilities; the Duke of Bedford was seen in a new
light. The method with which he went through the
Treaty, the great variety of matter of which through
the whole Debate he showed himself master, and the
coolness with which he mastered his own temper
too, made him considered as a very formidable and
able speaker.</p>

<p>Lord Halifax then rose and said, “They who disapprove
all treaties, cannot like this: they who are for
no connexion with the Continent&mdash;” the Duke of Bedford
interrupted him, and said, “That is not my
opinion.” Lord Halifax replied, “But very like it.”
The Duke again interposed, but the Duke of Argyle
called him to order, and with acrimony said, that he
had never seen such interruption given twice in one
Debate. Lord Halifax then continued, that if the
peace was not strengthened, it would only be a cessation
of arms: that we must not be parsimonious,
while France was dealing out a million in subsidies
(this had been a most exaggerated calculation of the
Solicitor-General<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> in the House of Commons), that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
she had offered more to Saxony, who had preferred
our alliance with the lesser sum. That the money
granted for Nova Scotia had been given to establish
the settlement, not to carry on a war: that if the
ships had been sent out too late last year, it was the
fault of the Admiralty; and that of all men he least
expected opposition from those two Lords, who had so
lately approved these treaties.</p>

<p>This was the accusation for which the Duke of Bedford
had waited; and he embraced it artfully. He
said, that this was so far from a preventive measure,
that it was more likely to raise a war; that he had
indeed said nothing hitherto to explain the consistence
of his own conduct, foreseeing that he might be
attacked on it. That he had always wished to detach
Bavaria from France, and thought it a great point
gained, though not with a view to engage that vote
for a King of the Romans; but that, while he had
acted in the Ministry, he had disapproved this profusion
of subsidies; and that, having made the most
earnest representations against that to Bavaria, he
had received the strongest assurances from <em>one</em>,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> who
had inclination to prevent, and power to hinder, that
the subsidy then granted to the Elector of Bavaria
should be the last we would give. He had then in
his pocket a letter from Mr. Pelham, with a solemn
promise of this.</p>

<p>Lord Granville put an end to the debate by a speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of spirit and humour; that the Motion was full of
inflammatory matter, and that it was drawing the
House into declaring against subsidiary treaties in
general: that France can be attacked by no single
Power; that leagues must humble her, subsidies cement
leagues. France has no Pretender to be set up against
her. She might say, “I will give no subsidies,”&mdash;and
yet she does. That formerly during his Embassies,
he had been asked by a great Prince<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> (the
King of Denmark) what we meant by that magnificent
bravado in the Preamble to our Mutiny Bill, where
we say, that we keep up eighteen thousand men to
preserve the balance of Europe. “I told him, my
Lords, ‘One day can make those eighteen fifty thousand.’
If you say you will pay no more electors,
you have erected a bridge without complete arches&mdash;and
what kind of policy is that, if this House rejects
a treaty already ratified by King and Commons! The
Court of France does not regard guarantees&mdash;or indeed
what Powers do? Would Prussia retain Silesia long, if
he had nothing to defend it with but the guarantee?
for, my Lords,” concluded he, laughing, “I must
bring out some of my secrets too.” The Motion was
rejected without a division. The next time the Duke
of Bedford went to Court, the King took no notice of
him; nor for some time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>
<p>29th.&mdash;Lord Harley, seconded by Northey, made a
Motion for declaring against subsidiary treaties in
time of peace. It occasioned a warm Debate; and
Prowse, escaping from his usual plausibility, said,
that he could discover no symptoms of economy in the
Administration, though indeed they had enforced it,
for by lowering interest, and by the land-tax of
three shillings, both landed and monied men were
reduced to be economists. Beckford, Fazakerley, Sir
Roger Newdigate, Morton, Sydenham, Cooke, Delaval,
and Sir Walter Blacket, spoke for the Motion:
Hampden against it, but with a sneer, said, that he approved
<em>bribing electors</em>, as he saw <em>by other instances</em>
how it had contributed to quash opposition. Mitchell
taxed old Horace Walpole with his unparliamentary
behaviour, in speaking on one side and voting on the
other. The Solicitor-General, Sir Henry Erskine,
Nugent, Ellis, Tracy, and Sir William Yonge, all opposed
the Motion; and lastly, Mr. Pelham, who seized
the opportunity of venting the anguish he had felt the
day before in the House of Lords (which from that
day he never attended more), and of abusing with
much bitterness and ability the Duke of Bedford and
Lord Sandwich. The Motion was rejected by 180 to
52. After the Debate, Mr. Pelham asked Fox, if he
had gone too far in invectives. “No,” answered
Fox, “as they began; though you originally gave
the provocation.” “Oh! Fox,” replied he, “you did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
not feel for me, as I should for you in the same
circumstances!”</p>

<p>In the beginning of February, Lord Cardigan was
appointed Governor of Windsor Castle, and was succeeded
as Chief Justice in Eyre by the Duke of
Somerset.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;Died Sir John Cotton; the last Jacobite of
any sensible activity.</p>

<p>21st.&mdash;Sir John Barnard, whose popularity had
suffered by the share he had had in reducing the
interest of the public debt to three per cent., made a
proposal to tie down six hundred thousand pounds a
year of the Sinking Fund, from the year 1758, towards
discharging the whole national incumbrance. Beckford
supported him; but Mr. Pelham and the Solicitor-General
opposing it, his scheme was rejected without
a division. We shall see him afterwards addressing
himself to his lost popularity with more success, and
as it often happens, on a worse foundation.</p>

<p>25th.&mdash;Lord Winchelsea had summoned the Lords
to consider an Admiralty Bill, which had passed the
Commons without opposition, and which was designed
to commute the punishment of transportation into
working in the Dockyards. Bills of less invidious
appearance had often raised a flame in combustible
seasons: this seemed to introduce a kind of galley
slavery, yet was really converting a species of disgraceful
criminals, who only corrupt our Plantations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
into useful members of society. Could the monthly
shambles at Tyburn (that scene that shocks humanity,
and reproaches our Police!) be exchanged for severe
labour in the same way, it would reflect honour on a
Legislature, which ought not to wanton in such
punishment of its members as death and banishment,
but to extract public utility, even from crimes. The
Duke of Newcastle, fearing to be attacked himself, and
the Chancellor, as apprehensive for his silent son-in-law,
Lord Anson, the head of the Admiralty and
patron of the Bill, prevailed on Lord Northumberland
to rise, commend the Bill, and then move to have it
put off for six weeks. The Duke of Bedford called
him to order for entering upon the Bill before it was
read.</p>

<p>28th.&mdash;Lord Tyrawley was sent to Lisbon, to accommodate
some differences which had been occasioned by
our Captains openly running Portugal pieces, which
had used to be brought on board our ships by the
<em>decent</em> intervention of the Monks.</p>

<p>The same day was read for the first time a Bill to
empower the Government to purchase, at the rate of
about an hundred thousand pounds, the estates in
Scotland forfeited by the late Rebellion, and which the
King was to cede to the public, in order to have
colonies settled on them, especially of Foreign Protestants.
The necessity of the purchase was pretended
to arise from mortgages on them, and which would
even <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'consume the propriety'">consume the property</ins> in a few years, and pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
them from the King’s hands into those of the mortgagees.
Grants of money to Scotland have ever been
suspicious: the influence of the Duke of Argyle over
the ductility of the Ministry was most notorious; the
claims now erected on these forfeitures most incredible;
and the establishment of Colonies in parts so barren,
so uninviting, of such unpleasant neighbourhood, most
improbable and impracticable. One circumstance alone,
of public notoriety, staggered all credit in the sum
demanded. Lord Lovat, at the bar of the House of
Lords, had declared that his was the best estate in
Scotland, for there were no debts upon it&mdash;it now appeared
charged with a mortgage of thirty thousand
pounds! Vyner, Northey, Beckford, Sydenham, Fazakerley,
Prowse, and the Whig-General Mordaunt,
opposed the Bill. The Scotch Lord Advocate, Mr.
Pelham, Sir William Yonge, and Oswald, with fine
warmth supported it, and it passed that day without
a division; and again on the second reading, March
2d, when it was faintly opposed by the same people,
and defended by the same, and by the Attorney-General.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>March 4th.&mdash;The Bill was reported: Vyner observed
that no retribution had been made to any
parts of England that had suffered by the Rebels,
though ten thousand pounds had been given to
Glasgow alone, to compensate their damages. Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
John Mordaunt asked with spirit, whether Englishmen
would go to these intended settlements for twenty
pounds a year, only to have land a fifth cheaper?
Whether the English Ministry meant to send 28,000
men only to starve? or whether they would suffer
themselves to be sent? He said, the Scotch were so
attached to the individual spots of their tribes, that
when Glenbucket had wanted to transplant his
M’Donalds to the site of the M’Phersons, the colonists
had been murdered, their houses burnt, and Glenbucket
himself received several wounds. That this
scheme would set the whole Highlands in a flame&mdash;“when
that is done,” said he, “I will congratulate
the gentlemen who brought in the Bill&mdash;in the mean
time, let me tell them, that so impotent or so supine
is the Government in that part of the island, that
there is now a person, a man of five hundred pounds
a year, who forced three or four hundred Drummonds
into the Rebellion, and has sons in Lord John Drummond’s
regiment in France, who lives tranquilly,
securely, on his own estate in Scotland, and triumphs
over the well-affected and loyal.”</p>

<p>General Campbell maintained the probability of
establishing the Colony in question, and instanced
in one at Strontean, where mines are carried on by
a company from hence, who are well received there,
who have polished the country, and where three to
one are well-affected. Legge said, that this system
will have more effect than all that had been done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
about dress and jurisdictions, because those regulations
were imposed by force; but this was to be
purchased: that the economy of the measure could
not be questioned, as, by buying mortgaged estates,
you may prevent future Rebellions, and consequently
avoid the heavy charges which Rebellion occasions.
That the Colony must be sent armed; and that for
some time the Army must be used as a succedaneum
to this measure, though force produces only artificial
loyalty in breasts, that will still be waiting for opportunities
of revenge; but that nest-egg of Rebellion
must be crushed in time of peace; that if this
measure is not adopted, the remaining alternatives
were, to acquiesce under incidental Rebellions, or to
exterminate the disaffected by fire and sword; that
what is loyalty or disloyalty here, is there food or
starving. Feed the clans, they will obey; starve
them they must rebel: that the means, therefore, of
eradicating this spirit in the common people are
obvious; polish them, introduce the arts of peace
amongst them&mdash;the disloyalty of the gentlemen is with
more difficulty to be subdued.</p>

<p>Lord Coke spoke with animosity<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> against the
measure, as being a Scotch measure; Lord Hilsborough
with approbation of it, as resembling what,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
he said, he had experienced in Ireland, where he had
seen mountains of Papists settled at last by Protestants,
after two or three colonies had been successively
driven off; and he said sensibly, “have we
6000 men who keep all Scotland in order, and will
they not be able to protect this little colony?”</p>

<p>Northey objected to the economy of a measure
which was pretended [to be] calculated to save the
expense of an Army, and yet must be put in execution
by an Army! and he stated the collusive
manner in which the calculation was drawn up, and
observed that the claims erected were 270,000<em>l.</em>;
that the estates to be purchased are 16,000<em>l.</em> a year;
that it is allowed, that there is personal estate sequestered
to the amount of 19,000<em>l.</em>; and yet that that
sum was not allotted towards the purchase. The
Report was agreed to by 171 to 34. Lord Gower’s
sons<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> were in the minority: none of the Duke’s
servants were present but Felton Hervey, and he too
was against the Bill.</p>

<p>7th.&mdash;Prince Edward, the young Prince of Orange,
and the Earls of Lincoln, Winchelsea, and Cardigan,
were declared Knights of the Garter: the Scotch
Earl of Dumfries had the Green Ribband, and Lord
Onslow the Red.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>
<p>Some differences happened upon a ship of ours
taking sailors out of an Embden vessel; and a Bill
was brought in to prevent insuring Embden ships.</p>

<p>9th.&mdash;The Scotch Bill was passed in the Commons,
on a division of 134 to 39.</p>

<p>March 10.&mdash;Lord Bath moved for an account
of the produce of the Window-tax in Scotland. It
had not, since first laid, brought in one shilling.</p>

<p>The Scotch Bill had hitherto only raised some
warmth in particular men, who either did not love
that nation from prejudice, or from resentments contracted
against them during the late Rebellion. It
now took a more serious turn. The Duke, who had
conquered the Scotch like an able General, who had
punished them like an offended Prince, and whose
resentments were not softened by the implacability of
their hatred to him, was not a little disgusted at
seeing measures of favour to them adopted, and himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
totally unconsulted upon those measures. Yet
he could not, as they were concerted by the King’s
Ministers, openly oppose them. It was almost as
difficult for him to blow up any opposition against
them underhand. The discontented in the House of
Commons were either the refuse of the late Prince’s
party, or the Jacobites; and even these latter could
not be supposed heartily eager against favours being
showered on their never-failing allies, the Scotch. In
the other House, the only phantom of opposition
consisted in half a dozen Jacobite Lords, and in the
person of the Duke of Bedford, between whom and
his Royal Highness a coldness had arisen, as has been
mentioned. In this dilemma the Duke lighted upon
a measure, which had ample effect. Lord Sandwich
was too much connected with him, and too much detached
from the Duke of Bedford, to make it expedient
to offer any overtures directly through him: but the
Duke sent him to a person<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> who had private connexions
with the Duke of Bedford, and who he knew would
not be sorry to traverse Mr. Pelham’s measures, to
offer him very extraordinary anecdotes on the Scotch
affairs, which he might impart to the Duke of Bedford.
It is strange how this train caught! That person
persuaded the Duke of Bedford to accept and make
use of the information, without knowing from whom
it came; and it must appear amazing, that a man
who could make so distinguished a figure as his Grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
did, by the management of the materials, should have
submitted to be put in motion so blindly!&mdash;but that
was his character; when he shone in public with
most energy, he perhaps acted the least upon his own
motives&mdash;but it is proper to enter into a deduction of
the Debate.</p>

<p>17th.&mdash;The Bill was read in the House of Lords. The
Duke of Bedford began with showing the impracticability
of the measure, from the difficulties both of
maintaining a colony on the forfeited estates, and of
procuring people to settle on them. Troops can be of
no service to support them in winter, unless forts are
built; an expense that would far exceed the views of
this Bill. English would not go thither; Irish cannot
be spared, for you must not weaken the Protestant
interest in that island; Scotch Highlanders will not
remove thither from their own fastnesses; <em>Germans</em>
indeed will migrate&mdash;but not to <em>worse</em> countries. But,
he asked, had the Ministry permitted the disloyal
inhabitants to remain upon these estates for six
years since the Rebellion, and did they now propose
to banish them? Would they engraft cruelty upon
their negligence? and that in a case which decides
the inhumanity, as it would punish the oppressed, yet
not derive any benefit to the public,&mdash;the only justifiable
pretence for national severities: for what benefit
will the public reap from the change of Lords, under
whom these Highlanders are to be placed by this
Bill? Indeed, he said, he feared such encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
was given to that country, by this and some other
Bills, as would, even in our time, produce a new Rebellion&mdash;Glasgow&mdash;the
great Lords, have received such
sums, such means of new commotions, as they could
have obtained no other way&mdash;and though particular
towns and persons are pretended to be relieved, money
is, through their channels, circulated over the whole
country, and we deprive ourselves of the advantages
that might accrue even from treason, when the disaffected
have contributed to despoil and impoverish
their own country. He feared Rebellion would grow
a national malady! Danger is even to be apprehended
from the method of putting this Bill in execution:
should the Commissioners not act, it is a needless,
an useless Bill&mdash;if they do, what is to encourage
them? power and interest? and into what hands are
you going to trust those formidable enemies? Are
you not taking the same method you took with Lord
Lovat? Will you empower more Lord Lovats to nurse
up more Rebellions? He was a single instance, and the
subsidy to him a trifle in comparison: this is a plan
for the most formidable power ever attempted hitherto
to be established in that country.</p>

<p>He then told the House, that he was but too well
founded in his apprehensions of new commotions, both
from the countenance showed to the disaffected, and the
discouragement given to the loyal. He told them that he
had in his hands a long and crying catalogue of facts,
which would prove both his assertions, and which facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
he was ready to prove. As a sample, he mentioned two
cases; the first of one John Cummings, who at the
time of the late Rebellion, being Collector at Montrose,
assisted the Rebels in seizing the Hazard sloop, for
which service the titular Duke of Perth appointed
him Collector for the Pretender. This Cummings, on
the Duke’s arrival in Scotland, was imprisoned by his
Royal Highness’s command, and carried into Inverness;
from thence he escaped, was again imprisoned, but at
the desire of Lord Milton was released by Mr. Bruce,
who had a power at that time to continue or to release
prisoners. This Mr. Cummings is now Collector of
Excise at Aberdeen; a place worth almost double of
what he formerly enjoyed at Montrose!</p>

<p>The other was the case of Hume of Munderson, a
man engaged in the former Rebellion, or, as the
Scotch call it, in the <em>fifteen</em>. His brother was executed
for the last Rebellion; but he himself has been made a
General Supervisor of Excise. “My Lords,” continued
the Duke, “these are among many flagrant
instances of the favour, I may truly say, of the
rewards conferred on Rebels. I can, if I am called
upon, produce many more equally striking, and of
what perhaps is still more alarming, of punishments
inflicted, or permitted to be inflicted on the well-affected
to his Majesty’s government and person. I
will not now recapitulate them, nor dwell even on the
fate of Mr. Davidson, Minister of Navar, above
Brechin in the Braes of Angus, who with sixty of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
parishioners was persecuted after the Rebellion, for
making bonfires on the Duke’s birth-day, under the
pretence of wilful fire-raising!”</p>

<p>After a pause, he said: “My Lords, these, and
facts like these, call for inquiry: what I have more to
say, strikes directly at the Bill itself, which various
circumstances concur to evince, is but a more extensive
job. Such is the impropriety of the time, the
end of a session, to offer a Bill of this nature,
when, so far from having leisure to examine it, we
have barely time to pass it; and that this must have
been the effect of design is evident, since the Report of
the Barons of the Exchequer, who were to examine
into the nature and state of these forfeitures, was
given in so long ago as December, 1749. The money
to be raised is a most unjust burthen upon England:
the Commissioners at least, who ought to see this Act
put in execution, ought to be English. If they are
not, we are grounded to suspect that this money will be
as much perverted as other taxes have been fallaciously
collected. Let us cast our eyes but on the produce of
the coach-tax in that part of the United Kingdom; to
what does it amount? for the first year to one thousand
pounds!&mdash;for the second, to what? to nothing.
Must we suppose that this burthen was so heavily felt,
that the whole Nobility and Gentry of Scotland at once
concurred to lay down their equipages? In those years
England paid on the same account 60,000<em>l.</em>, 58,000<em>l.</em>
If such are their partialities, is it not allowable for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Englishmen to have some? Be that as it may, my
Lords, let us know what grounds there are for these
complaints, for these accusations. I move your Lordships
to put off the farther consideration of this Bill,
till we have had time to inquire into facts.”</p>

<p>It required more art than the Chancellor possessed,
to efface the impression made by this speech. To
dispute the facts would be admitting that they ought to
be examined. He thought the most prudent method was
to admit their authenticity, but to endeavour to show
that the previous examination of them was not necessary,
either in that place, or before the conclusion of the
Bill. This method he followed; it served to palliate
the resolutions of a majority of which he was secure;
but had that bad effect for the Ministry, that the
Duke of Bedford’s assertion of the facts, and the
Chancellor’s admission of them, or at least his not disputing
them, left the world persuaded of their reality,
and of the timidity, indolence, or wickedness of the
Administration.</p>

<p>The Chancellor, therefore, in a very long and elaborate
speech, said, that if what had been advanced
against the Bill was true, it was one of the worst
Bills on the best plan that ever was formed. That
indeed the Bill was only a part of the plan formerly
concerted of buying the jurisdictions of the great
Lords into the hands of the Crown; and that it fell
in naturally enough to that plan, as these estates must
necessarily be sold. That the only blame he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
have expected was that this Bill had not been
brought in sooner. Formerly the complaint had been
that forfeited estates were restored and given back from
the Crown. That indeed he did believe many of the
claims upon these estates were fictitious: however,
they must be determined in Scotland; here is the last
place where they must be examined. That this Bill
alone can enable you to have fair purchasers; and that
if the claims are fraudulent, it is an additional reason
for passing such a Bill; otherwise, the original proprietors
might re-acquire their estates for nothing.
That the great view of the Government was to destroy
clanships; his own great wish, to see the King a great
Highland landlord: that one of the chief benefits to
arise from this scheme, secondarily to the extension of
loyalty, is the improvement of the linen manufactures,
an establishment at once so useful to our
trade, and so inconsistent with arbitrary principles,
that there had been but three single men of those
manufacturers engaged in the last Rebellion. That
with regard to the difficulty of finding colonists,
he did not doubt but some English might be
prevailed on to settle there, probably some Lowlanders
too, nay, some Irish, if they can be spared.
He believed, indeed, that the greater part of the old
inhabitants must remain at first; but that some of
the well-affected clans might be induced to transmigrate
to those settlements; and that he did not despair
of reclaiming even the present tenants, at least in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
next generation of them, if they were once emancipated
from dependence on their chiefs. That the
danger from distributing money among the disaffected,
formerly so impolitic a measure of King William, must
not be considered here in that light; this is not money
to bribe traitors, but to pay lawful creditors; and
that he had rather even fraudulent creditors should
enjoy this money than have the estates revert to
their old proprietors. That even the position laid
down of encouragement given to Rebellions by
largesses to that country, was not true; it was the
restitution of forfeited estates which had hardened
them to attempt new commotions; but that if we
were still to see repeated insurrections, every Rebellion
cuts off so much strength from the faction.
That indeed, as to the article of the Commissioners,
he wished those words, <em>without fee or reward</em>, were
not in the Bill; that he must own he saw many
just grounds of complaint, but could not approve
national reflections. That to the honour of that
country he must say, the linen manufactures were
carried on by Directors who received no salary. If these
Commissioners should prove less meritorious, or more
blameable, they are not for life; they are removable.
That now he must take a little notice of the heavy
accusations enforced by the noble Duke; but previously
he must observe, that it is not proper in a
Debate, to raise objections from particular facts, which
people cannot be prepared to answer. That Cummings’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
case was so flagrant, that if it was inquired
into, he did not doubt but it would be remedied. But
what did this and the other instances prove, but the
want of the Bill? That another view of the Bill
was, to raise towns and villages and stations <em>for</em>
troops; not that it would take away the want <em>of</em>
troops: that the money, supposing it a large sum, was
but little in comparison of the benefits it was calculated
to purchase: is it not a little sum, if it prevents
only one Rebellion?</p>

<p>If it was true, as the Duke of Bedford had asserted,
and as he believed it was, that the Lowland share of
the forfeited estates was not mortgaged to the full
value, and that therefore they ought to be sold altogether,
and the overplus go towards the purchase, for
his part he believed nobody would advise his Majesty
to sell those estates. That he did not believe
the claims would be allowed to the extent given in;
that the King, of his grace, may give the overplus
towards the purchase, but that he should not advise
it: he should rather advise that the distribution
should be made to reward loyalty; for instance, could
a nobler use be made of it, than in rewarding Sir
Harry Monroe, who and whose family had done and
had suffered so much for the service of the Crown?
That the last thing of which he should take notice,
was the insufficient manner in which the taxes had
been collected in that northern quarter of the Kingdom:
some method, to be sure, should be taken to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
make Scotland pay her taxes; but could any Ministry
ever hit upon that method? it is not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitium temporis</i>
that the Ministers have not done the impossible thing.
One good effect the very proposal of this will have, if
it points out, or leads to a remedy for the nonpayment
of these taxes.</p>

<p>The young Marquis of Rockingham entered into a
Debate so much above his force, and pertly applied
the trite old apologue of Menenius Agrippa, and the
sillier old story of the Fellow of a College, who asked
why we should do anything for Posterity, who had
never done anything for us!</p>

<p>Lord Bath then joined the Duke of Bedford’s opposition,
after first reflecting on that Duke himself, who
he said had entered his complaint both ways, that the
Bill had not been brought in soon enough, and had
been brought in too late. That for himself, he could
not but think the proposal of examining the claims
first very material. Should he, would any man, purchase
an estate, before he had examined the nature
and validity of the incumbrances? That on the first
face of the account, he could descry false claims and
misprision. On one little estate of thirty pounds a
year he observed a mortgage of four thousand pounds.
Who, he asked, had been in possession of these
16,000<em>l.</em> per annum since they had been forfeited? If
the Government, where is the receipt? who accounts
for it? If the creditors, why is not so much struck
off from their claims? What must England say, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Scotland pays nothing towards four million of taxes?
What must she say, when the weight of these taxes
has been increased by Rebellions raised in Scotland?
But who is it, must he ask, who takes upon them to
remit taxes? Kings had been driven out for arrogating
a dispensing power! where will these partialities
end? He concluded with proposing a Bill to
be enacted for punishing any frauds relative to forfeitures.</p>

<p>The Chancellor replied, that the Bill had been prepared
as soon as possible, and had been brought in
soon after Christmas. That the time for sale would
lapse, and the estates fall to the mortgagees, if the
Bill should now be postponed. That the mortgages,
though real, could not extend beyond the value of the
estates, which, he said, was a case frequent enough in
Chancery.</p>

<p>Then rose a man, on whom all eyes had turned
during the Debate&mdash;the Duke of Argyle. How was
every expectation disappointed! As his power was
uncontrolled in Scotland; as partialities could only be
exercised under his influence, or connived at by his
intrigues; as the Bill was known to be a sacrifice
made to his ascendant; as its practicability had been
questioned; who but himself was answerable, for
favour to Jacobites, for tyranny to the loyal, for the
necessity, for the utility, or for the feasibility of the
regulation in question? He looked down, seemed
abashed, spoke low and but a few words, then contemptuously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and at last said nothing to refute the
charge of partialities, or in defence of the Bill. He
only said, “What would have happened if any Scotch
Lord had spoken against it? it would have been said,
they are for keeping up their old barbarity and power.
Whereas, the clans are to transfer their allegiance to
Commissioners appointed by the King during his
pleasure. If any man suspected him to be so low, as
to have private views in this, God forgive him! That
with regard to taxes, such difficulties there had been
on the old tax on houses, that it had never been paid:
few counties had even named their Collectors. That
the window tax, if paid, would raise but 6000<em>l.</em>, and
ninety-nine Collectors would have but fifteen shillings
a piece. That on the coach tax there was no deficience.
For himself, he despised reports.”</p>

<p>Lord Tweedale spoke after him, and with passion;
but as nobody expected any great lights from him, so
he disappointed nobody.</p>

<p>The Duke of Newcastle, <em>flustered</em> by the Duke of
Bedford’s attack, and confounded by the Duke of
Argyle’s no defence, seemed to speak only to mark his
own confusion, and to enforce what the Duke of Bedford
had urged. He said he had taken minutes of
the names mentioned by his Grace, and hoped such
recommendations would be taken no more. That he
had already sent the King’s orders to apprehend some
Rebels still resident in Scotland; but as yet they
could not be taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus much effect followed: Cummings and some
others in the Duke of Bedford’s list were removed.
The Bill passed; but though one great argument for
driving it on had been the danger of the estates
lapsing, neither English nor Scotch Ministers chose
to have it discussed any further in Parliament. The
Duke of Cumberland, who was present, did not vote.
The Court Lords were fourscore; the minority only
twelve: the Dukes of Bedford and Kingston; the
Earls of Bath, Chesterfield, Sandwich, and Macclesfield;
with six Tory Lords, the Duke of Beaufort, the
Earls of Lichfield and Oxford, and the Lords Wentworth,
Ward, and Maynard. Mr. Pelham was enraged
beyond measure at the Duke of Argyle; the King
charmed with the Duke of Bedford; and both these
sensations were heightened by the Duke giving his
father a list of sixty Jacobites, who had been preferred
in Scotland since the Rebellion.</p>

<p>26th.&mdash;The King put an end to the session; and
the Speaker, in his speech to him, launched out in
invectives against the management in Scotland.</p>

<p>I shall conclude the history of this Bill with the
character of its patron, not its defender, the Duke of
Argyle.</p>

<p>Archibald Campbell, Earl of Isla, was younger
brother of the admired John, Duke of Argyle, whom
he succeeded in the title, and with whom he had little
in common, but the love of command. The elder
brother was graceful in his figure, ostentatious in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
behaviour, impetuous in his passions; prompt to insult,
even where he had wit to wound and eloquence
to confound; and what is seldomer seen, a miser as
early as a hero. Lord Isla was slovenly in his person,
mysterious, not to say with an air of guilt in his
deportment, slow, steady where suppleness did not
better answer his purpose, revengeful, and if artful,
at least not ingratiating. He loved power too well
to hazard it by ostentation, and money so little, that
he neither spared it to gain friends or to serve them.
He attained the sole authority in Scotland, by making
himself useful to Sir Robert Walpole, and preserved
it by being formidable to the Pelhams. The former
had disgusted the zealous Whigs in Scotland by
throwing himself into the arms of a man of such
equivocal principles: the Earl pretended to return it,
by breaking with his brother when that Duke quarrelled
with Sir Robert: yet one chief cause of Walpole’s
fall was attributed to Lord Isla’s betraying to
his brother the Scotch boroughs entrusted to his management
in 1741. It must be told, that Sir Robert
Walpole always said, he did not accuse him. Lord
Isla’s power received a little shock by Lord Tweedale’s
and Lord Stair’s return to Court on that Minister’s
retreat; but like other of Lord Orford’s chief associates,
Lord Isla soon recovered his share of the
spoils of that Administration. He had been ill with
the Queen (of whom he knew he was sure while
he was sure of Sir Robert Walpole) from his attachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
to Lady Suffolk: he connected with Lord Granville,
while Lord Granville had any sway; and as
easily united with the Pelhams, when power was their
common pursuit, and the humiliation of the Duke
and the Duke of Bedford the object of their common
resentment; for common it was, though the very
cause that naturally presented them to the Duke of
Argyle’s hatred, their zeal and services, ought at least
to have endeared them to the brothers.</p>

<p>By a succession of these intrigues, the Duke of
Argyle had risen to supreme authority in Scotland:
the only instance wherein he declined the full exertion
of it was, when it might have been of service to the
master who delegated it; in the time of the Rebellion:
at that juncture he posted to London: the King was
to see that he was not in Rebellion; the Rebels,
that he was not in arms. But when this double conduct
was too gross not to be censured, he urged a
Scotch law in force against taking up arms without
legal authority; so scrupulously attached did he pretend
to be to the constitution of his country, that he
would not arm in defence of the essence of its laws
against the letter of them. In his private life, he had
more merit, except in the case of his wife, whom
having been deluded into marrying without a fortune,
he punished by rigorous and unrelaxed confinement
in Scotland. He had a great thirst for books; a
head admirably turned to mechanics; was a patron of
ingenious men, a promoter of discoveries, and one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
first great encouragers of planting in England; most
of the curious exotics which have been familiarized to
this climate being introduced by him. But perhaps
too much has been said on the subject of a man, who,
though at the head of his country for several years,
had so little great either in himself or in his views,
and consequently contributed so little to any great
events, that posterity will probably interest themselves
very slightly in the history of his fortunes.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>31st.&mdash;The King set out for Hanover: the Duke of
Newcastle, who attended him, would not venture himself
in any yacht but the one in which Lord Cardigan
had lately escaped a great storm.</p>

<p>While the King was absent, a scene was opened in
a remote part of his dominions, which had not been
accustomed to figure on the theatre of politics.
Ireland had for many years been profoundly obedient
to the Government. The Roman Catholics were too
much overbalanced by the power of the Protestants
to be formidable: the latter were too certain on any
change of Government, to meet with no quarter from
the professors of a religion, by whose plunder they
were enriched, not to be inflexibly attached to the
Prince on the Throne. Yet the insolence or wantonness
of two men, new to power, contrived in a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
to throw that kingdom into a flame, and to create
factions, who soon imbibed all the inveteracy of party,
except disaffection. The internal councils of Ireland
were chiefly guided by Mr. Boyle, the Speaker of the
House of Commons, and Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and during the absence of the Lord-Lieutenants, one
of the Lords Justices. He was vain and popular,
and as the idols of the people and of themselves generally
are, a man of moderate capacity. It had been
the unvaried practice of the Lord-Lieutenants to
court this man, and to govern the House of Commons
by his interest: the steadiness of his principles was
unquestionable. Lord Harrington, the last Governor,
had been much disliked, but conforming himself to
this maxim, some discontented persons<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> had in vain
attempted to give disturbance to the King’s affairs.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by the Duke of Dorset, who was
a man of dignity, caution, and plausibility, and who
had formerly ruled Ireland to their universal satisfaction.
But he then acted from himself; he was now
in the hands of two men most unlike himself, his
youngest son, Lord George Sackville, and Dr. George
Stone, the Primate of Ireland. The former, a man
of very sound parts, of distinguished bravery, and of
as honourable eloquence, but hot, haughty, ambitious,
obstinate. The Primate, a man of fair appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of not inferior parts, more insinuating, but by no
means less ambitious, had with no pretensions in the
world, but by being attached to the house of Dorset,
and by being brother of Mr. Stone, been hurried
through two or three Irish Bishopricks up to the very
Primacy of the kingdom, not only unwarrantably
young, but without even the graver excuses of learning
or sanctimony. Instead of attempting to conciliate
the affections of a nation offended at his promotion, he
thought of nothing but governing by the same influence
by which he had been raised. Lord George, as little
disposed to be controlled, would not stoop to the usual
management for Mr. Boyle; and he was not likely to
be persuaded to observe any attentions by the Primate,
who had shaken them off himself. The Speaker, who
had not lost his taste for power by being accustomed
to it, was soon alarmed, and had an opportunity of
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'revenge offerred'">revenge offered</ins> to him almost as soon as the offence.</p>

<p>The Duke of Dorset had recommended to the Parliament
to provide more barracks for the soldiers, and
to inquire into the late abuses of the money destined
to that service. This was obliquely aimed at Lord
Harrington, and intended, by casting odium on his
Administration, to heighten the popularity of the new
Lord-Lieutenant; but it had different and much
further consequences than the junto had foreseen.
The money was voted; but the Parliament, in prosecution
of abuses, fell upon one Neville Jones, a
creature of the Primate, and determined to express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
their aversion to that Prelate, by sacrificing his tool.
When it is told that, till the era in question, no
Opposition had been able to unite above eight-and-twenty
voices in the Irish House of Commons against
the Government, it will appear surprising that the
contagion of new discontents should in a few weeks
have infected even the majority there. Faction is as
capricious as Fortune: wrongs, oppression, the zeal of
real patriots, or the genius of false ones, may sometimes
be employed for years in kindling substantial
opposition to authority; in other seasons, the impulse
of a moment, a ballad, a nickname, a fashion can
throw a city into a tumult, and shake the foundations
of a state. Spain, which surely must sometimes produce
some heroic, some patriot natures, has groaned
for centuries under tyranny and the Inquisition: the
poor fisherboy of Naples, Massaniello, could, in the
space of two days, set at defiance, overturn, a haughty,
an armed, an established Government. It is certain
that no innovation, no unwonted exertion of power,
had provoked the Irish: but they thought themselves
contemned: they saw the channel of power totally
diverted from the natives: the indiscretion of the
rulers presented a colour to the keenest invectives
that a faction could wish to employ.</p>

<p>The Speaker furnished himself as chief to the faction;
but they had wiser heads to direct both them
and their chief. Of these were, Carter, the Master
of the Rolls, Sir Richard Cox, and Malone. Carter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
had always been a Whig, but had as constantly fomented
every discontent against the Lord-Lieutenants,
in order to be bought off: an able, intriguing man, of
slender reputation for integrity. Sir Richard Cox
was a patriot, and the first deviser of the linen manufactures,
which have been of such essential service to
his country. He and Malone were distinguished
orators, and had both been gained by Lord Harrington,
but were neglected by the new Court at the
Castle. Malone’s family were Popish, and his own
conversion suspected. But the Speaker was for some
time the only ostensible idol of the party’s adoration:
to a confessed integrity and loyalty he united a
romantic readiness for single combat, so much to the
taste of his countrymen. The Castle were desirous of
raising Mr. Ponsonby, a son of Lord Besborough,
and son-in-law of the Duke of Devonshire, to the chair.
The Parliament of Ireland, unless specially dissolved,
sits during a whole reign, and the Speaker’s dignity
is of the same duration. Lord George’s measures
were apt to be abrupt: he directly offered the Speaker
a Peerage and a pension of 1500<em>l.</em> a year. The
Speaker replied, “If I had a Peerage, I should not
think myself greater than now that I am Mr. Boyle:
for t’other thing, I despise it as much as the person
who offers it.” This, and some indirect threats
equally miscarrying, and the Castle finding that their
creature Jones must be the first victim, endeavoured
to defer what they could not prevent. The Speaker’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
party moved for a call of the House for that day three
weeks; Lord George Sackville moved to have it that
day six weeks&mdash;and was beat! Whoever<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> has seen
the tide first turn in favour of an Opposition, may
judge of the riotous triumphs occasioned by this
victory. The ladies made balls, the mob bonfires, the
poets pasquinades&mdash;if Pasquin has seen wittier, he
himself never saw more severe or less delicate lampoons.
The Address that was soon after sent over to
the King, applied directly to him, and not as was
usual to the Lord-Lieutenant; and they told his
Majesty, in plain terms, that it was from apprehension
of being misrepresented. This was an unpleasant
potion for the Duke of Dorset to swallow&mdash;but we
must adjourn the further account of these dissensions
to their proper place in order of time, and proceed to
open a new scene of division at home, in which
one of the principal actors was intimately connected
with the Court-faction in Ireland.</p>

<p>In the former part of these Memoirs, it has been
mentioned, that the young Prince of Wales, on the
death of his father, was placed by the King under the
care of the Earl of Harcourt, as Governor; of Dr.
Hayter, Bishop of Norwich, as Preceptor; and of
Mr. Stone and Mr. Scott, as Sub-governor and Sub-preceptor.
The two former were favourites of Lord
Lincoln, the ministerial nephew: Stone was the bosom-confidant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of the Duke of Newcastle: Scott, as well
as the Solicitor-General, Murray, and Cresset, the
favourite of the Princess, were disciples of Lord
Bolingbroke, and his bequest to the late Prince. Stone,
in general a cold, mysterious man, of little plausibility,
had always confined his arts, his application, and
probably his views, to one or two great objects. The
Princess could answer to all these lights: with her,
he soon ingratiated himself deeply. Lord Harcourt
was minute and strict in trifles; and thinking that he
discharged his trust conscientiously, if on no account
he neglected to make the Prince turn out his toes, he
gave himself little trouble to respect the Princess, or
to condescend to the Sub-governor. The Bishop,
thinking himself already Minister to the future
King, expected dependence from, never once thought
of depending upon, the inferior Governors. In the
education of the two Princes, he was sincerely honest
and zealous; and soon grew to thwart the Princess,
whenever, as an indulgent, or perhaps a little as an
ambitious mother, (and this happened but too frequently),
she was willing to relax the application of
her sons. These jars appeared soon after the King’s
going to Hanover: and by the season of his return,
they were ripe for his interposition.</p>

<p>The English Court at Rome was as little free from
intestine divisions as the Hanoverian Court at London.
The Cardinal of York, whose devotion preserved
him from disobedience to his father as little as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Princely character had preserved him from devotion,
had entirely abandoned himself to the government
of an Abbé, who soon grew displeasing to the old
Pretender. Commands, remonstrances, requests, had
no effect on the obstinacy of the young Cardinal. The
father, whose genius never veered towards compliance,
insisted on the dismission of the Abbé. Instead of
parting with his favourite, the young Cardinal with
his minion left Rome abruptly, and with little regard
to the dignity of his Purple. The Holy See, which
was sunk to having few more important negotiations
to manage, interested itself in the reconciliation, and
the haughty young Eminence of York was induced to
return to his father, but without being obliged to
sacrifice his Abbé. As I shall not often have occasion
to mention this imaginary Court, I will here give a
cursory picture of it.</p>

<p>The Chevalier de St. George is tall, meagre, melancholy
in his aspect. Enthusiasm and disappointment
have stamped a solemnity on his person, which rather
creates pity than respect: he seems the phantom,
which good-nature, divested of reflection, conjures up,
when we think on the misfortunes, without the demerits,
of Charles the First. Without the particular
features of any Stuart, the Chevalier has the strong
lines and fatality of air peculiar to them all. From
the first moment I saw him, I never doubted the legitimacy
of his birth&mdash;a belief not likely to occasion
any scruples in one whose principles directly tend to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
approve dethroning the most genuine Prince, whose
religion, and whose maxims of government are incompatible
with the liberty of his country.</p>

<p>He never gave the world very favourable impressions
of him: in Scotland, his behaviour was far from
heroic. At Rome, where, to be a good Roman-catholic,
it is by no means necessary to be very religious, they
have little esteem for him: it is not at home that they
are fond of martyrs and confessors. But it was his ill-treatment
of the Princess Sobieski, his wife, that
originally disgusted the Papal Court. She, who to
zeal for Popery, had united all its policy, who was
lively, insinuating, agreeable, and enterprising, was
fervently supported by that Court, when she could no
longer endure the mortifications that were offered to
her by Hay and his wife, the titular Counts of Inverness,
to whom the Chevalier had entirely resigned
himself. The Pretender retired to Bologna, but was
obliged to sacrifice his favourites, before he could re-establish
himself at Rome. His next Prime Minister
was Murray, nominal Earl of Dunbar, brother of the
Viscount Stormont, and of the celebrated Solicitor-General.
He was a man of artful abilities, graceful
in his person and manner, and very attentive to
please. He had distinguished himself before he was
of age, in the last Parliament of Queen Anne, and
chose to attach himself to the unsuccessful party
abroad, and for whose re-establishment he had co-operated.
He was, when still very young, appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Governor to the young Princes, but growing suspected
by the warm Jacobites of some correspondence with
Sir Robert Walpole, and not entering into the favourite
project of Prince Charles’s expedition to Scotland, he
thought fit to leave that Court, and retire to Avignon,
where, while he was regarded as lukewarm to the
cause, from his connexion with the Solicitor-General
here, the latter was not at all less suspected of devotion
to a Court where his brother had so long been
First Minister.</p>

<p>The characters of the Pretender’s sons are hitherto
imperfectly known; yet both have sufficiently worn
the characteristics of the house of Stuart&mdash;bigotry and
obstinacy and want of judgment. The eldest set out
with a resolution of being very resolute, but it soon
terminated in his being only wrong-headed.</p>

<p>The most apparent merit of the Chevalier’s Court
is the great regularity of his finances, and the economy
of his exchequer. His income before the Rebellion
was about 23,000<em>l.</em> a year, arising chiefly from pensions
from the Pope and from Spain, from contributions
from England, and some irregular donations
from other Courts. Yet his payments were not only
most exact, but he had saved a large sum of money,
which was squandered on the unfortunate attempt in
Scotland. Besides the loss of a Crown, to which he
thought he had a just title, besides a series of disappointments
from his birth, besides that mortifying
rotation of friends, to which his situation has constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
exposed him, as often as faction and piques
and baffled ambition have driven the great men of
England to apply to or desert his forlorn hopes, he
has, in the latter part of his life, seen his own little
Court and his parental affections torn to pieces, and
tortured by the seeds of faction, sown by that master-hand
of sedition, the famous Bolingbroke, who insinuated
into their councils a project for the Chevalier’s
resigning his pretensions to his eldest son, as more
likely to conciliate the affections of the English to his
family. The father, and the ancient Jacobites, never
could be induced to relish this scheme. The boy and
his adherents embraced it as eagerly as if the father
had really a Crown to resign. Slender as their Cabinet
was, these parties divided it; and when I was at
Rome, Lord Winton was a patriot at that Court, and
the ragged type of a minority, which was comprehended
in his single person.</p>

<p>In September, the Margrave of Anspach, nephew
of the late Queen, and to whom on that relation the
King had given the Order of the Garter, wrote a circular
letter to the Princes of the Empire, to dissuade
them from holding a Diet of Election, till it was declared
necessary to have a King of the Romans. The
King was unlucky in his German alliances. The Landgrave
of Hesse, and the Duke of Saxe Gotha, the one
father-in-law of the Princess Mary, the other, brother
of the Princess of Wales, declared themselves against
the election.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>With these disappointments, the King returned to
England, and arrived at St. James’s, November 18th.
The Princess appeared again in public, and the King
gave her the same honours and place as the Queen
used to have. He was not in the same gracious mood
with others of the Court. The calamity of Lord
Holderness, the Secretary of State, was singular; he
was for some days in disgrace, for having played at
blindman’s-buff in the summer at Tunbridge. To
Lord Harcourt, the King said not a word. In the beginning
of December, the Chancellor and the Archbishop
sent to Lord Harcourt that they would wait on him
by the King’s command: he prevented them, and went
to the Chancellor, who told him that they had orders
to hear his complaints. He replied, “They were not
proper to be told but to the King himself,” which did
not make it a little suspicious, that even the Princess
was included in his disgusts. The first incident that
had directly amounted to a quarrel, was, the Bishop
of Norwich finding the Prince of Wales reading Père
d’Orleans’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revolutions d’Angleterre</cite>; a book professedly
written by the direction, and even by the communication,
of James the Second, to justify his measures.</p>

<p>Stone at first peremptorily denied having seen that
book in thirty years, and offered to rest his whole justification
upon the truth or falsehood of that accusation.
At last it was confessed that the Prince had
the book, but it was qualified with Prince Edward’s
borrowing it of his sister Augusta. Stone acted mildness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and professed being willing to continue to act
with Lord Harcourt and the Bishop: but the sore
had penetrated too deep, and they, who had given the
wounds, had aggravated them with harsh provocations.
The Bishop was accused of having turned
Scott one day out of the Prince’s chamber, by an imposition
of hands, that had at least as much of the flesh as
the spirit in the force of the action. Cresset, the link of
the connexion, had dealt out very ungracious epithets
both on the Governor and Preceptor; and Murray, by
an officious strain of strange imprudence, had, early in
the quarrel, waited on the Bishop, and informed him,
that Mr. Stone ought to have more consideration in
the Prince’s family: and repeating the visit and
opinion, the Bishop said, “He believed that Mr.
Stone found all proper regard, but that Lord Harcourt,
the chief of the trust, was generally present.”&mdash;Murray
interrupted him, and cried, “Lord Harcourt!
pho! he is a cipher, and must be a cipher, and
was put in to be a cipher.” A notification, however
understood before by the world, that could not be
agreeable to the person destined to a situation so
insignificant! Accordingly, December 6th, Lord
Harcourt had a private audience in the King’s closet,
and resigned. The Archbishop waited on his Majesty,
desiring to know if he would see the Bishop of
Norwich, or accept his resignation from his (the
Archbishop’s) hands. The King chose the latter.</p>

<p>The Junto did not find it so easy to fix new ciphers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
as to displace the old. Dr. Johnson, the new Bishop
of Gloucester, was the object of their wishes for Preceptor;
but his education with Murray and Stone, and
his principles, which were undoubtedly the same as
theirs (whatever theirs were), proved obstacles they
could not surmount. The Whigs were violently
against his promotion; the Archbishop strongly
objected to him. It was still more difficult to accommodate
themselves with a Governor: the post was at
once too exalted, and they had declared it too unsubstantial,
to leave it easy to find a man, who could fill
the honour and digest the dishonour of it. Many
were named; some refused it. At last, after long
waving it, Lord Waldegrave, at the earnest request of
the King, accepted it, and after repeated assurances of
the submission and tractability of Stone. The Earl was
very averse to it; he was a man of pleasure, understood
the Court, was firm in the King’s favour, easy
in his circumstances, and at once undesirous of rising,
and afraid to fall. He said to a friend, “If I dared,
I would make this excuse to the King; Sir, I am too
young to govern, and too old to be governed.”&mdash;But he
was forced to submit. A man of stricter honour, or
of more reasonable sense, could not have been selected
for the employment; yet as the Whig zeal had caught
flame, even this choice was severely criticized. Lord
Waldegrave’s grandmother was daughter of King
James; his family were all Papists, and his father had
been but the first convert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>The Preceptor was not fixed till the beginning of
the new year, but I shall include his promotion here,
not to interrupt the thread of the narration: it was
Dr. Thomas, who during the first civil war of
Leicester-house, had read prayers to the present King:
it was not till within two years of this period that the
King had found an opportunity of preferring him,
and then made him Bishop of Peterborough. He was a
man of a fair character, esteemed rather a Tory in his
principles. It may not be unentertaining to mention
another instance of the King’s good fortune in being
able to promote an old friend. General Legonier one
day went and offered his Majesty the nomination to a
living in his gift. The King expressed the greatest
joy and gratitude, and said, “There is one I
have long tried to make a Prebendary, but my
Ministers never would give me an opportunity; I am
much obliged to you, I will give the living to him.”</p>

<p>This year, soon made remarkable by some extraordinary
occurrences, opened quietly; at least with
events scarcely worth recording. A few independents
of Westminster attempted, on the death of
their representative, Sir Peter Warren, to revive an
opposition to the Court, by again presenting Sir
George Vandeput to the mob; but the idol’s holiday
was past; and he himself soon declined the
contest. The Earl of Marchmont, adopted into the
Court, moved the Address in the House of Lords,
but coldly and unanimated; the fire and acrimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
which made him shine in Opposition were gone, and
no grace had succeeded. In the other House, Lord
Egmont reflected on the Address, which he said, he
expected would have been prudent and discreet, but
found some parts of it improper and vain-glorious:
that he believed the measures were well intended,
but would prove unsuccessful; that the College of
Princes had objected to an election of a King of
the Romans; that the new memorial of the King of
Prussia, outwardly relative to the Silesian loan, was
founded, he believed, on that Prince’s dissatisfaction
with our conduct in the affair of the election; that
he desired to avoid petulance, but thought it improper
to give approbation to measures as wise, in
which no wisdom had appeared, and that therefore, in
wording the Address, he would omit the words <em>wisdom
as well as</em> goodness; that he acknowledged the
goodness, not the wisdom. Mr. Pelham replied,
that he thought the noble Lord (<em>who was as accurate
as anybody in writing</em>)<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> had made a false
emendation; that the purpose of maintaining peace
was all that was aimed at in the speech; who
would not own the wisdom as well as the goodness of
his Majesty in this? This is all the speech says: is
it good in the King or in Ministers to pursue bad
measures? there cannot be great goodness and little
wisdom.</p>

<p>Feb. 9th.&mdash;Lord Egmont, in the course of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Mutiny Bill, moved to have oaths administered to
evidences on regimental Courts Martial. He still
combatted the giant of military power: Sir Henry
Erskine, the old companion of his chivalry, was now
the first to oppose him. The consideration, at the
motion of Lord George Sackville, was deferred till
the report.</p>

<p>13th.&mdash;The Duke of Bedford moved to have the
accounts of Nova Scotia laid before the House.
Lord Halifax added, that all letters to and from the
Secretary of State relative thereto should be produced.
The Duke of Newcastle opposed this, and
desired that only extracts might be brought. The
Duke of Bedford artfully inflamed this contest,
praised Lord Halifax, and acquiesced.</p>

<p>15th.&mdash;Was published the Duke of Newcastle’s
answer to the Memorial presented by Mons.
Michell, Secretary of the embassy from the King of
Prussia. This Memorial and other papers had
been presented in November and December of the
preceding year, and was a pretended justification
of the Prussian King’s conduct in stopping the last
payment of the money due to the subjects of Great
Britain on the Silesian loan. This money had been
borrowed of private persons in the year 1734 by
the Emperor Charles VI., and he had mortgaged to
them as a security his Revenues arising from the
Duchies of Upper and Lower Silesia, for payment
of principal and interest, till the whole debt should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
be discharged, which was fixed to be in the year 1745.
But no sooner was the Imperial debtor dead, than the
King of Prussia seized the province of Silesia, on
the cession of which to him in form by the treaty of
Breslau in 1742, he agreed to take the debt upon
himself, and to stand exactly in the place of
the Emperor; and actually did continue to discharge
part of it; but being intent on erecting himself
into a naval Power, and as intent on traversing
the views of his uncle, he had involved himself in
squabbles with England by transporting and furnishing
naval and hostile stores to France on board his
Embden ships, some of which had been taken by
our men of war, some condemned, some restored.
These discussions not turning out to his satisfaction,
or he being determined not to be satisfied, at
length resolved to detain the last payment on the
Silesian loan; that is, after a certain balance had
been liquidated by his own Ministers, he stopped
about 30,000<em>l.</em> of 45,000<em>l.</em> which were due, and
offered to our subjects to pay the remainder, provided
they would give a full and authentic discharge
for the whole debt: a transaction the more
arbitrary and unjustifiable, as his complaints were
not dated till 1746, and the whole debt ought to
have been discharged the year before. The measure
was violent and insulting, and a glaring comment
on the inconveniences resulting from our connexions
with the Continent. The great superiority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the navies of Great Britain over the baby fleet of
Prussia, the only arms by which nations so separated
could come to any discussion of interests, was
too evident for that Prince to have dared to
hazard his infant hopes in so unequal a contest,
had he not been sensible that we had a pawn on
the continent with which he might indemnify himself
for any exertion of British resentment;&mdash;and
indeed, while we have this pledge staked for our
good behaviour, every petty Prince who is a
match for Hanover is too powerful for England;
nor is it a question any longer what nations can
cope with Great Britain, but, what little Landgrave
is too formidable to the Electorate?</p>

<p>With the Duke of Newcastle’s letter was delivered
a confutation of the Memorial, drawn up
by Sir George Lee, Dr. Paul, the King’s Advocate
for Civil Law, Sir Dudley Rider, Attorney,
and Mr. Murray, Solicitor General. The examination
was made in concert by all, the composition
solely by the last; and perhaps few pieces in any
language can stand in comparison with it, for elegance,
perspicuity, art, and argument. The genius
of the author did honour to his country in a performance
of such notoriety; but perhaps the dignity
of England had been less hurt, if we had been
made appear to be less in the right. What advantage
was there in having the better of the argument against
a Prince, who lay out of danger from the resentments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of Great Britain, while Hanover lay at his
mercy? It is unseemly for great nations to combat
with the pen; and except in the scholastic reign of
James the First, England never dictated to other
kingdoms by a superiority in controversy. What
is still more striking, and a remark that I might,
but will not often make, scarce a murmur followed
this supineness of conduct. Even those who suffered
in that tender point, their interest, seemed contented
with our pedantic victory. In the year 1743, a
yellow sash worn by the King in the field, and one
or two Hanoverian prejudices as trifling, were on
the brink of raising a Civil War in this country.
In the year 1753, both national honour and
national avarice could not, did not attempt to
raise so much as a Debate in the House of Commons
in their own defence! A little spark, in comparison,
kindled the flame that followed.</p>

<p>At the end of the last year, while the dissensions
in the tutorhood had been carried so high, an
anonymous Memorial,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> pretended to have been
signed by several Noblemen and Gentlemen of the
first rank and fortune, had been sent to five or
six particular persons: it ran in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><em>A Memorial, &amp;c.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">The Memorialists represent,</p>

<p>That the education of a Prince of Wales is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
object of the utmost importance to the whole
nation.</p>

<p>That it ought always to be entrusted to Noblemen
of the most unblemished honour, and to Prelates
of the most disinterested virtue, of the most
accomplished learning, and of the most unsuspected
principles, with regard to government both in
Church and State.</p>

<p>That the misfortunes, which this nation formerly
suffered or escaped under King Charles the First, King
Charles the Second, and King James the Second,
were owing to the bad education of those Princes,
who were early initiated in maxims of arbitrary
power.</p>

<p>That, for a Faction to engross the education of
a Prince of Wales to themselves, excluding men of
probity, property, and wholesome learning, is unwarrantable,
dangerous, and illegal.</p>

<p>That, to place men about a Prince of Wales,
whose principles are suspected, and whose belief in
the mysteries of our Holy Faith is doubtful, has
the most mischievous tendency, and ought justly
to alarm the friends of their country, and of the
Protestant Succession.</p>

<p>That, for Ministers to support low men, who
were originally improper for the high trust to
which they were advanced, after complaints made
of dark, suspicious, and unwarrantable means made
use of by such men in their plan of education; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
to protect and countenance such men in their
insolent and unheard of behaviour to their superiors,
is a foundation for suspecting the worst
designs in such Ministers, and ought to make all
good men apprehensive of the ambition of those
Ministers.</p>

<p>That, it being notorious that books inculcating
the worst maxims of government, and defending
the most avowed tyrannies, have been put into the
hands of the Prince of Wales, it cannot but affect
the Memorialists with the most melancholy apprehensions,
when they find that the men who had
the honesty and resolution to complain of such
astonishing methods of instruction are driven away
from Court, and that the men who have dared to
teach such doctrines are continued in trust and
favour.</p>

<p>That the security of this Government being built
on Whig principles, and alone supported by Whig
zeal; that the establishment of the present Royal
Family being settled on the timely overthrow of
Queen Anne’s last Ministry, it cannot but alarm
all true Whigs, to hear of schoolmasters of very
contrary principles being thought of for Preceptors;
and to see none but the friends and
pupils of the late Lord Bolingbroke entrusted with
the education of a Prince, whose family that Lord
endeavoured by his measures to defeat, and by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
writings to exclude from the Throne of these
kingdoms.</p>

<p>That, there being great reason to believe that a
noble Lord has accused one of the Preceptors of
Jacobitism, it is astonishing that no notice has
been taken of a complaint of so high a nature;
on the contrary, the accused person continues in
the same trust, without any inquiry into the
grounds of the charge, or any steps taken by the
accused to purge himself from a crime of so black
a dye.</p>

<p>That no satisfaction being given to the Governor
and Preceptor, who, though a nobleman of the
most unblemished honour, and a Prelate of the
most unbiassed virtue, have been treated in the
grossest terms of abuse, by a menial servant in
the family, is derogatory to his Majesty’s authority,
under which they acted, is an affront to the Peerage,
and an outrage to the dignity of the Church.</p>

<p>That whoever advised the refusal of an audience
to the Lord Bishop of Norwich, who was so justly
alarmed at the wrong methods which he saw taken
in the education of the Prince, is an enemy to his
country, and can only mean at best to govern by a
faction, or is himself influenced by a more dangerous
faction, who intend to overthrow the Government,
and restore the exiled and arbitrary House
of Stuart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>That to have a Scotchman of a most disaffected
family, and allied in the nearest manner to the
Pretender’s First Minister, consulted on the education
of the Prince of Wales, and entrusted with
the most important secrets of Government, must
tend to alarm and disgust the friends of the present
Royal Family, and to encourage the hopes and
attempts of the Jacobites.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Memorialists cannot help remarking,
that three or four low, dark, suspected persons are
the only men whose situation is fixed and permanent,
but that all the great offices and officers are
so constantly varied and shuffled about, to the
disgrace of this country, that the best affected apprehend
that there is a settled design in those
low and suspected persons to infuse such jealousies,
caprices, and fickleness into the two Ministers
whose confidence they engross, as may render this
Government ridiculous and contemptible, and facilitate
the Revolution, which the Memorialists think
they have but too much reason to fear is meditating.</p>

<p class="center">God preserve the King!</p></div>


<p>Of these papers, one had been sent to General
Hawley, and another to Lord Ravensworth. The
former immediately carried one copy of his to the
Duke, who gave it to the King, and another to the
Duke of Newcastle, whose fright was only equalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
by the noise raised by other copies of the Memorial,
which was soon dispersed. Whoever was ill at or
discontented with the Court, whoever was popular,
whoever was remarkably Whig, were said to be in
the number of the Memorialists. But why Hawley
was selected for one of the first copies, was not so
easily guessed. It was well said, by somebody,
that it was judiciously intended by the author, if
he meant to have it propagated; for as Hawley
could not read, he must of necessity communicate
it to others. Why Lord Ravensworth received one
was obvious. He was reckoned one of the warmest
and honestest Whigs in England. His being
reckoned so, was a reason for the authors of the
Memorial to address one to him; perhaps not their
only reason; perhaps their thinking him rather a
factious and interested, than an honest Whig, was
the chief inducement to them to sow their seeds of
discontent in a rank soil, which did indeed produce
an ample crop.</p>

<p>In the beginning of February, Lord Ravensworth
came to town, and acquainted Mr. Pelham that he
had strong evidence of Jacobitism to produce against
Stone, Murray, the Solicitor-General, and Dr.
Johnson, Bishop of Gloucester. The notification
was not welcome; yet could not be overlooked
nor stifled. Lord Ravensworth had already communicated
his intention of having the affair sifted
to the Duke of Devonshire, the Chancellor, Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Anson, and Mr. Fox, the latter of whom he had
consulted, whether he should carry the notice to
the King or to the Duke. Mr. Fox told him that
the Duke never meddled out of his own province,
the Army. The Ministry determined, against the
opinion of Lord Granville, that the Cabinet Council
should hear Lord Ravensworth’s information.</p>

<p>On the 15th, 16th, and 17th, the Cabinet
Council sat long and late, but with much secrecy,
inquiring into this affair. The first night Lord
Ravensworth was heard for four hours. The
purport of his accusation was, that some few weeks
before at Durham, one Fawcett, an Attorney,
reading the newspaper which mentioned the promotion
of Dr. Johnson to the Bishopric of Gloucester,
said “He has good luck!” Being asked what
he meant by that expression, he had replied, “Why,
Johnson has drunk the Pretender’s health twenty
times with me and Mr. Stone and Mr. Murray.”
Dr. Cowper, Dean of Durham, who had been present
at this dialogue, was called, and in a short and
sensible manner confirmed Lord Ravensworth’s
account. The conversation made no noise at the
time; only Dr. Chapman, master of Magdalen College
in Cambridge, gave private intelligence of it to
Harry Vane, a creature of the accused triumvirate,
and he, by Mr. Pelham’s order, wrote to Fawcett
to know the meaning of this imputation. Fawcett
denied what he had said, and acquitted the Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
of the charge. The clamours against Stone, on his
quarrel with the Bishop of Norwich and Lord Harcourt,
and the Memorial reaching Lord Ravensworth
soon after this conversation happened, he
determined to signalize his zeal, and hastened to
London, Fawcett having confirmed to him what he
had denied to Vane, but begging not to be produced
as an accuser.</p>

<p>16th, Fawcett was examined: never was such an
instance of terror and confusion! yet with reluctance
and uncertainty he owned that what he had uttered
at Durham was true. The substance of his evidence
was, “that, about twenty years ago, Murray,
then a young Lawyer, Stone, then in indigence, and
himself, had used to sup frequently at one Vernon’s,
a rich Mercer, a noted Jacobite, and a lover of ingenious
young men. The conversation was wont to
be partly literature, partly treason; the customary
healths, <em>The Chevalier</em> and <em>Lord Dunbar</em>.”</p>

<p>Had the greater part of the Council not wished
well to the accused, it must have shocked them to
hear a charge of such consequence brought after an
interval of twenty years, brought on memory, the
transactions of a private company, most of them
very young men, at worst flattering an old rich
bachelor of no importance, and, in their most unguarded
moments, never rising beyond a foolish
libation to the healths of their imaginary Monarch
and his Minister. Considering the lengths to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
party had been carried for the last twenty years;
considering how many men had been educated at
Oxford about that period, or had been in league
with every considerable Jacobite in the kingdom,
if such a charge might be brought after so long a
term, who almost would not be guilty? Who
almost would be so innocent as not to have gone
beyond a treasonable toast? It was necessary to be
very Whig to see Lord Ravensworth’s accusation in
an honourable light.</p>

<p>17th, Lord Ravensworth and Fawcett were
called to sign their Affidavits: the latter asked if
he might alter his? The Chancellor told him he
might add for explanation, but not make two Affidavits.
He said, “My lords, I am fitter to die
than to make an Affidavit.” He contradicted many
things that he had told Lord Ravensworth, and
behaved so tragically, yet so naturally, that the
Council were too much moved to proceed, and
adjourned.</p>

<p>The accused were warm and earnest in denying
the charge: Stone in particular affirming, that he
would allow the truth of all that had been alleged
against him for the last six months, if he had so
much as once drunk the Pretender’s health in the
most envenomed companies, even when a student at
Oxford; adding many menaces of prosecuting Fawcett
for calumny. Such minute assurances from
one so suspected, or such strains of prudence in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
very youth, did not much contribute to invalidate
Fawcett’s testimony in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>19th, the House of Commons went on the supply
for Nova Scotia, as opened by Lord Duplin.
Colonel Cornwallis, just returned from that Government,
gave a short and sensible account of the
colony, where, he said, the trade and improvements
had been carried to as great a height as could be
expected in the time. Beckford spoke strongly in
behalf of the colony, and for attending to the West
Indies, where all our wars must begin and end;
that till we attended to our Navy, we had done
nothing in the last war; how preferable this, to
flinging our money into the gulf of Germany! He
commended Cornwallis, and the Board of Trade.
Sir Cordel Firebrace inquired into the state of the
civil government; Cornwallis gave it. Gray spoke
for improving it. Mr. Pelham desired to have it
remembered, that the support of the colony was
the sense of the House; and he told Beckford, that
if he would praise oftener where it was deserved,
his reproofs would be more regarded.</p>

<p>The Council sat late again that night: Fawcett
collected more resolution; said, that Lord Ravensworth
had been in the right to call upon him; that
it was fact that he had been with the three accused
when the treasonable healths were drunk; that at
such a distance of time, he could not swear positively
that they drank them; but he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
endeavour with time to recollect particular circumstances.</p>

<p>21st and 22nd, the Council continued sitting, and
heard Mr. Stone purge himself, who, with other
articles of defence, called Bishop Hay Drummond to
the character of his principles.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, Mr. Murray appeared before them,
but rejected impetuously the reading of the Depositions:
he said, he was positive to their falsehood,
be they what they might: as he was aware that
suspicions might arise from the connexions of his
family, he had lived a life of caution beyond even
what his principles would have dictated.</p>

<p>Lord Ravensworth grew unquiet. Fawcett’s
various and uncertain behaviour distressed him:
though the world was willing to believe the accused
Jacobites, the evidence did not tend to corroborate
the opinion: was drinking a treasonable health all
the treason committed by men from whom so much
danger was apprehended? Were no proofs of disloyalty
more recent than of twenty years to be
found against men who were supposed involved in
the most pernicious measures? If no acts of a
treacherous dye could be produced against them
since they came into the King’s service, might it
not well be supposed, that their views and establishment
under the present Government had washed
out any stains contracted by education or former
adulation? and it did appear that Vernon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Mercer had actually made Murray the heir of his
fortunes. Lord Ravensworth consulted the Speaker,
who advised him to establish his own truth, in
having received the advertisement from Fawcett&mdash;but
neither was that denied, nor the drinking the
healths disbelieved, though both Stone and Murray
at the last session of the Council on the 26th, when
the latter made an incomparable oration, took
each a solemn oath, that the charge was absolutely
false.</p>

<p>The Council made their report to the King,
signed unanimously, that Fawcett’s account was
false and scandalous&mdash;yet the Duke of Grafton, one
of the unanimous, owned to Princess Emily, that
Fawcett being asked if he had seen Mr. Murray
since he had been in town, confessed he had, that
he had been sent to him by Harry Vane. “What
did Mr. Murray say to you?” “He advised me to
contradict what I had said.” And the Chancellor,
who communicated the whole transaction to the
Duke of Bedford, seemed to own Mr. Murray guilty.
How his jealousy of Murray, and his mean court
to Stone, made him choose to distinguish between
them, will appear still more strongly hereafter.</p>

<p>The King’s acceptance of Lord Ravensworth’s
zeal was by no means gracious. Whether those
frowns provoked, whether the Cabinet censure might
inflame, whether disappointment from the ill success
of such notable policy had soured, or whether he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
was still persuaded that the House of Hanover was
in danger by employing men who had had such
dangerous connexions in their youth with a Jacobite
Mercer, Lord Ravensworth was eager and busy in
blowing up farther and more public inquisition.
His temper was naturally hot; he was reckoned
honest; two strong motives to prevent his acquiescing
calmly to the disgrace he had received. His
manner of prosecuting his measure, whatever was
the end, was neither warm nor over-righteous.
He tampered with the Duke of Bedford, communicated
his papers to him, and even told him that it
would not be disagreeable to him to be called upon
in the House of Lords to explain his conduct. Yet
to others he protested that he had no dealings with
the Duke. His Grace was warned of this intricate
behaviour; yet being still warmer than Lord
Ravensworth, and incapable of indirect policy himself,
he slighted the notice; and on March 16th,
acquainted the Lords, that on the Thursday following
he should move for the papers relating to
the examination of Stone and Murray. This was a
strain of candour a little beyond what was exacted
by honour or policy. If the notification exceedingly
embarrassed the Ministry, it must be owned that the
measures they concerted, from the time given them
by the Duke, were as discreet and artful as could be
devised.</p>

<p>The 22nd was the day of expectation. The House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
was crowded. The Duke of Bedford began with
observing that the public attention had been so
engrossed by the late Cabinet Councils, that he was
not surprised at the multitude he found assembled
to hear the discussion, or at least to get some light
into an affair, which, though touching the public so
nearly, had been wrapt in such mysterious secrecy:
such solemn councils held on treason, yet so little
known of either accusation or process!&mdash;the effects
indeed, the acquittal and the continuation of confidence,
were divulged and notorious. His difficulties
in a disquisition of this tender nature were great;
difficult it was for him, after repeated obligations,
to name the name of his Majesty&mdash;yet, if ever he
should suggest a doubt, he could only mean his
Majesty’s Ministers. It is the very spirit of the
Law, the King can do no wrong&mdash;and not only the
language of Law and of Parliament, it was the language
of his heart&mdash;his experience of the King had
taught it him: his Majesty cannot err, but when
facts are not fairly stated to him. Those who state
them unfairly, may misrepresent me. “The notoriety,”
said the Duke, “that an inquest of treason
had been in agitation, made me conclude that it
must be brought hither for our advice&mdash;could I
doubt but it would? What other Judicature is
there for crimes and criminals of this high nature?
The incompetence of the Lords who had been assembled
for this trial was evident: can the Cabinet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Council condemn? Can they acquit? if they
cannot condemn nor acquit, can they try? or who
that is accused, is innocent, till he has had a more
solemn purgation than their report can give him?
But if no character can be purified by their verdict,
what becomes of their own? My Lords, what a
trust is reposed in the Cabinet Council! Can
they be at peace till their opinions are sanctified
by our sentence? But why do I talk of their
satisfaction? the nation has a right to be satisfied.
Here is an accusation of treason brought against
men in such high and special trust, that the
Councils of his present Majesty, and the hopes of
the nation in the successor, are reposed in them:
and this charge brought by a Lord of Parliament,
who&mdash;but it is not for me to enter upon
facts; the Lord himself is present, and has given
me leave to call upon him: he showed me papers,
though he said, he was fully satisfied that he had
cleared his own character&mdash;I call upon that
noble Lord to give your Lordships the necessary
information.”</p>

<p>Lord Ravensworth, not from want of any facility
of expressing himself, for his manner was natural
and manly, but from perplexity of mind, whether
to own or not to own that he had instigated the
Duke of Bedford to this examination, was ambiguous
and unsatisfactory; and he endeavoured to
cover his ungenerous behaviour to that Duke with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
frankness and candour. He said, that by the King’s
consent, he had received what papers he thought
necessary, that is, he had received his own examination
and the report&mdash;indeed, he had not been
permitted to have a copy even of Harry Vane’s
letter. For his part, he had determined to proceed
no farther. When the Duke of Bedford asked him,
he had shown him the examination, not the report.
That he had told his Grace that it would not be
disagreeable to him to have the whole world know
the story, and let them judge on it. That he
should never have sought this discussion, yet could
not but be glad of it. That so many aspersions
had been thrown on him, that he believed his story
had never been twice told in the same manner.
That he had represented to the Ministers, as was
his duty, what he had heard, and had left it to
them to proceed upon as they should think proper&mdash;that,
now he was called upon, he was willing to
lay open the whole to their Lordships, provided
they would allow him to name a Lord of Parliament,
who was concerned in the affair, and was now
present&mdash;but must first desire that they would let
himself be sworn to the strict veracity of what he
should say.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford told him, that as the Lord
was present, he might name him, unless it was opposed;
that the Lord, if he thinks proper, may
retire: that it would be very irregular for Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Ravensworth to be sworn. The Duke of Newcastle
said, that he supposed it proceeded from the
Bishop’s ignorance of the forms of the House, that
he had not risen and given leave to be named; but
that he would answer for his Lordship’s permission.
The Bishop of Gloucester (the person hinted at)
pleaded ignorance of forms, and consented to the
free mention of his name. Lord Ravensworth told
him, that as he was perfectly acquitted, the Lords
would be ready to do him justice. Lord Ravensworth
then told the story shortly, clearly, well: that
company having dined with the Dean at Durham
on the King’s birth-day, as two of them, Fawcett
and a Major Davison, were drinking coffee with the
Dean in the evening, and reading a newspaper
which mentioned a report that Dr. Johnson was to
be Preceptor<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> to the Prince of Wales, Fawcett said,
“He has good luck! twenty years ago he was a
Jacobite.” That this conversation had seemingly
been forgot: but that on the 12th of January following,
as he (Lord Ravensworth) was at a Club
at Newcastle with Fawcett, the latter had showed him
a letter from Harry Vane, inquiring into the meaning
of those words. That he recollected no particulars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
of the letter&mdash;and he said with emphasis,
<em>This letter, my Lords, I have not</em>. It only, as
far as he remembered, expressed that Mr. Vane was
desired and authorized by Mr. Pelham to inquire
into that conversation, as it had occasioned some
talk. He dwelt on his great regard to Mr. Pelham,
and said, that urged by that motive, he had desired
Fawcett to come to him the next day; that he
had exhorted him to stick to the truth, and in
four several conversations had always found him
uniform. In those conversations he added the
names of Mr. Stone and Mr. Murray&mdash;then, my
Lords, I took it up; it then grew important. I
feel none higher, none of more moment than Mr.
Stone. That he had advised Fawcett to write no
answer, but to go to Mr. Pelham; he went. That
what tended to confirm his own suspicions, and led
him to believe the imputed connexion, was his
finding, upon inquiry, that Vernon had been a
notorious Jacobite; that Mr. Murray had been
Vernon’s sole heir. That some other incidents had
not weakened his doubts; that Mr. Murray had
advised Fawcett to let the affair drop; that Bishop
Johnson said Fawcett had acquitted him in a letter
written to him; the letter had been written to the
Bishop, but his Lordship stood by while Fawcett
wrote it. That soon afterwards the Bishop would
have persuaded Mr. Fawcett to add these words, <em>and
this is all I can say consistent with truth</em>. Fawcett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
refused. He concluded with saying, “My Lords, I
was not the accuser; I told the Ministers, that,
having come to the knowledge of the accusation, I
was determined to bring the affair to light in some
shape or other. I did it from duty and from zeal,
not, as has been said, to revenge the quarrel of a
noble Lord,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> my friend, who has quitted a shining
post on some disgusts with some of the persons involved
in this charge.”</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford observed, that Lord Ravensworth
had made some omissions in his narration,
of which, as he had given him leave, he would
put him in mind&mdash;to which the other replied hastily,
that he had communicated nothing to the Duke
from the last papers he had received, only from his
own examination. The Duke owned that he had
not seen the report; but took notice that Lord
Ravensworth had forgot to mention that Fawcett
had kept no copy of Vane’s letter, and that Fawcett
had owned to the Council that he had given Lord
Ravensworth all the information which the latter
affirmed to have received from him. The Chancellor,
who was to conduct the solemn drama of the
day, took care to keep off all episodes that might
interfere with the projected plan of action, and interrupted
the two Lords, by laying it down for
order, that Lord Ravensworth must not repeat
what he had only <em>heard</em> passed in Council. But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
authoritative decision was treated as it ought to be
by the Duke of Bedford, who with proper spirit
launched out upon the indecent assumption of
power in the Council, a step that added double
weight to the reasons for bringing this matter before
Parliament. That indeed even the Chancellor’s
supposing it had been brought before the <em>Council</em>
was an unfounded assertion; that he denied its
being the <em>Council</em>; it was only a private meeting
of certain Lords&mdash;were they a Committee of Council?
as such was it, that they arrogated the power
of tendering oaths, and listening to voluntary evidences?
if they were, the President of the Council
should have presided&mdash;but here was no President,
no forms, no essence, no authority of Council. In
their own persons only these Lords were respectable.
The Secretary of State is no Justice of Peace. An
unheard-of jurisdiction had been attempted to be
erected, unknown to this country, derogatory from
the authority of this House! Before this revived
Star-chamber, this Inquisition,&mdash;different indeed
from the Inquisition in one point, for the heretics
of this court were the favourites of it!&mdash;before this
court the accused were admitted to purge themselves
upon oath&mdash;a leading step to the introduction
of perjury! But what was the whole style of
their proceedings? mysterious! secret! arbitrary!
cruel! The minutes are secreted; the witnesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
were held in a state of confinement:<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Lord Ravensworth
was required to deliver up letters: orders for
filing informations against Fawcett were given&mdash;or
said to be given&mdash;“for I doubt the intention of
carrying them into execution,” said the Duke:
“though, if they are pursued, the hardship on
Fawcett will be the greater, as he is already pre-judged.”
The report, concise as it was, was three-fold:
it pronounces Fawcett’s accusation false and
malicious; it pronounces the accused innocent; it
justifies Lord Ravensworth, the accuser! how many
powers assumed! Fawcett, though a lawyer, was
terrified at such a court!</p>

<p>“It was their proceedings,” the Duke said, he
blamed; he had great regard for more than half of
the Lords concerned, yet he must say they had
erred greatly, if their proceedings were anything
more than preparatory. However, these transactions
did not strike him more than the high rank
of the accused. Mr. Stone stands in as public a
light as any man in Britain&mdash;there are other points
in which the public should be satisfied too&mdash;for his
part he had never conferred with the reverend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
and noble Lords,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> who had lately retired from that
important turbulent scene, yet he owned their resignations
had already filled him with suspicions.
They had been dismissed for no misbehaviour: he
hoped they would vouchsafe to lay their motives
before the House, that, <em>in this acquitting age</em>,
they too may be disculpated&mdash;nay, the Council too
should be disculpated; it should be manifest that
they were not biased, and that their report is
fit to see the light. Seen to be sure it will be; it
cannot be meant to be secreted. Till it is produced,
the world is left to perplexity, to argue in
the dark&mdash;till more is known, one is apt to dwell
on the uniformity of Fawcett’s behaviour for four
different times&mdash;no deviation, no inconsistence in
his narrative, till after his interviews with Bishop
Johnson and Mr. Murray&mdash;then it grew retrograde&mdash;then
he faltered in his evidence&mdash;this gives suspicion;
this calls for the whole system of the
Council’s procedure&mdash;how to produce that properly
he did not know.</p>

<p>“You all wish the accused may be cleared;
assist me, my Lords, in dragging into light every
testimonial of their innocence: it is our natural
business; and at the same time no business more
arduous on which to give the King advice. Here
he may want it; sinister advices may make our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
unbiased, honest opinions more necessary, more
welcome.” The noble Lord who presided lately
over the education of the Prince, has been as well
replaced as possible; the choice was the more acceptable,
as it was his Majesty’s own&mdash;<em>he</em> can do
no wrong; he always acts right, when he acts
himself. The time is proper for inquiring into this
affair; it is no longer under examination; nor
could he be told, as he generally was, “<em>we have a
clue: don’t stop us: these are the King’s secrets</em>.”
This inquiry can be attended with no inconvenience;
it may be attended with good: the King
desires to have the accused persons cleared. For
the papers that are denied, they must be produced
in Westminster-hall, if Fawcett is prosecuted&mdash;there
<em>the King’s secrets</em> must come out. That now was
not merely the proper, it was the only time for
searching into the character of the person entrusted
with the education of the Prince&mdash;should a minority
happen (and sorry he was he had not been able to
be present and to give his dissent to a Bill of so
pernicious a precedent and nature as the Regency
Bill!) if that dreaded contingency should happen,
might not they who are possessed of the person and
authority of the King,&mdash;might not they, however
suspected, however accused, shelter themselves
under the clause of præmunire; a clause calculated
not to guard the person of the Prince, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
persons of his Governors from danger? He moved
for all the papers, examinations, and letters, that
had been before the Cabinet Council.</p>

<p>The Chancellor, with acrimonious tenderness,
began with protesting, that he should have taken
this for a factious motion, had it not come from a
Lord of so unsuspected a character&mdash;but he would
enter at once into the matter. Lord Ravensworth
had applied to have the affair examined, and his
Majesty had ordered his Council to inquire into it.
Mr. Stone had made the deepest asseverations of his
innocence; nay, he went so far as to beg that the
distance of time might be thrown out of the question,
and that if the least tittle of the accusation
could be proved against him, his guilt might be
considered as but of yesterday. That the term
<em>Cabinet</em> Council, said to be borrowed from France,
was no novelty; that it was to be found in the
Journals of Parliament. That the Duke of Devonshire
being added by his Majesty’s particular order
on this occasion, was not unprecedented. That it
had been called by our ancestors, sometimes the
Cabinet for Foreign Affairs; sometimes the Cabinet
for Private. How they corresponded as a Council
in Queen Elizabeth’s time might be seen in Forbes’s
State Papers. That they had not proceeded by
compulsory summons: that it had been determined
in Westminster-hall, that a Secretary of State may
administer oaths. That Magistrates indeed might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
not accept the oath of an accused person: here in
truth their oaths had been accepted now by an
act of grace, which was the more excusable, as they
were subject to no punishment from the Council
that examined them. That this had been an inquiry
for satisfaction, not for prosecution: that
their oaths was the only satisfaction to be obtained:
Vernon was dead; nobody else was present at these
pretended treasonable meetings, (this was false, for
he presently afterwards urged in their favour, that
Mr. Cayley, who is living, and used to be present,
had been examined, and could remember no such
passages;) that the oaths had not been administered
by authority, but admitted at their own desire. He
commended the great solemnity of the proceedings,
and added, we have all of us the King’s leave
to answer any questions.</p>

<p>He dwelt on the prevarications and inconsistence
of Fawcett’s behaviour, who had often said that he
could not charge anybody but himself. He then
turned to encomiums on the zeal and conduct of
Mr. Stone during the Rebellion; and mentioned
Mr. Cayley’s evidence. Slightly he mentioned Mr.
Murray, who, he said, had always behaved in his
court in an irreproachable and meritorious manner
from the year 1742. (Servile was this court to
Stone; envious this transient approbation of
Murray!) He added, that no orders had been
given for the prosecution of Fawcett&mdash;but in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
higher tone he talked of the impropriety of the
Motion: that no prerogative was so appropriate to
the King as the government of his own family:
that ten Judges had declared for it<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>&mdash;therefore,
you will not wantonly invade it&mdash;have you any
distrust of the Lords who have sifted this matter?
to what good end would further inquiry tend?
That much he was surprised how the Regency Bill
came to be drawn into the question! Is there one
word in that Bill of the Governors of the Prince
of Wales? He never knew that the noble Duke had
disapproved that Bill. He reflected with pleasure
on the many converts that had been made from
Jacobitism, and hoped that by raking into old
stories their Lordships would not prevent and discourage
change of principles: that it would make
those who were willing to come over to the pale of
loyalty dread parliamentary inquiries hanging over
their heads: they would never think themselves
safe: and it would be ungenerous to exclude men
of any principles from enjoying the sunshine and
blessings of such a Reign and Government&mdash;for his
part he hated names and distinctions, and to stifle
any attempts for reviving them would give his
negative to the Motion.</p>

<p>Lord Harcourt rose next, and though a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
abashed as never accustomed to speak in public,
said, with great grace and propriety, that he
thought the King had the best right to judge in
his own family; that he had communicated to his
Majesty alone the reasons of his dissatisfaction in
the government of the Prince: his Majesty had not
thought his reasons good; he had therefore resigned
a post which he thought he could not hold with
credit and reputation.</p>

<p>If the decency and consistency of this speech had
wanted a foil, it would have found it in Lord Talbot’s
subsequent harangue; who said, that if the
Motion had come from a person of less known
integrity, he should have thought it dictated by a
spirit of confusion. That some indeed love the
Crown, some a jumble of Administrations. That
a very sensible man drunk, may make a very good
Jacobite: that he knew Fawcett, and had had a
good opinion of him; but that often where he
thought there was most perfection, he had found
least. That he would not have acted like Lord
Ravensworth&mdash;yet&mdash;(what a <em>yet</em> after such a prelude!)
shall a private Council exclude the activity
of the greater? The management of the Royal
Children is of public import: shall the Council engross
the direction of them? Hereafter, if this
precedent is suffered, a cabal of Ministers will be
worse than the Star-chamber. The precedent will
be used to stifle all inquiries against sycophants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
by applying to the Crown to appoint a trial by the
Cabinet Council.</p>

<p>Hayter, Bishop of Norwich, the late Preceptor,
with no less decency than Lord Harcourt, but with
a little more artful desire of inflaming the prejudice
against Stone and Murray, said that he would not
declare the reasons of his resignation till he should
be forced. That all he would say was, that he
had met with obstructions from inferiors, <em>most
cruel obstructions</em>. That he did not think himself
at liberty to appeal from the King, <em>yet would
willingly tell if he was obliged to it</em>. This insinuating
offer the Duke of Bedford had not the presence
of mind to take up; and the Bishop’s gauntlet
not being challenged, he could not with propriety
go any farther. Perhaps the Ministry had not
more reason to triumph on the event of the day,
than on the Duke of Bedford’s overlooking so fair
an opening into their most vulnerable part!</p>

<p>At last rose the Bishop of Gloucester. If provocation
often sharpens the genius, it did not in
his case. Yet he was not confused, he was insolent:
he spoke like a man that had governed children,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
not like one fit to govern them. His language
and circumstances were vulgar and trivial; he
dwelt more on his housemaid letting in Mr. Fawcett
when he came to him, than on any part of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
defence. He said, he did not doubt but their Lordships
would treat this accusation with the abhorrence
it deserved. That for himself, he yielded
to many on the Bench for capacity, he would not
to any in loyalty. That he had had promises of
favour formerly from his Grace of Bedford, and
hoped he had not forfeited them: that it was not
true that there had long been a scheme of making
him Preceptor; that [he] himself had never heard
of it till he was at the Hague, and then he was
told of such a design by a noble Duke, who had
heard it from a noble Lord, who had heard such a
report&mdash;but not one of his own friends had thought
of it for him: that if his Majesty had designed it,
he did not know it. That in the Roman state,
when informers were most rife, yet nothing had
happened of this kind. He insisted on the badness
of Fawcett, and affirmed that he did not dictate
to him the letter for himself, though he owned
he stood by while Fawcett wrote it; and that two
days afterwards, when he desired Fawcett to add
some words to it, they were not, <em>This is all I
can say consistent with truth</em>, but, <em>This is the
truth</em>.</p>

<p>Lord Ravensworth entirely acquitted the Bishop,
and added this extraordinary problem, that Fawcett’s
character was so bad only from its being so
good. He desired to know of all the Lords, whether
they did not acquit him; and whether they did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
believe that Fawcett had told him all he had
announced.</p>

<p>Of the Duke of Newcastle’s speech, an hour in
length, I shall touch but a few of the most remarkable
passages, such as, after acquitting Lord Ravensworth,
were his panegyric on Harry Vane, <em>who
never said a false thing, or did a bad one</em>! and
another, scarce less exaggerated, on the Duke of
Devonshire’s <em>sagacity</em>, for which his Majesty had
ordered him to be added to the Council. Of his
own immediately going to the King, and saying,
“Sir, I am come to keep my promise; that you
should be the first to hear any complaints against
Stone; if he is a Jacobite, he is a greater traitor to
me than to you.” How Stone, who had had the
fate of kingdoms in his breast, had desired to have
the accusation examined, and to be sequestered
from his attendance on the Prince of Wales, till he
should be acquitted; and lastly, how these stories
had been propagated by cabal and intrigue, and by
the anonymous Memorial sent assiduously all over
the kingdom, full of falsities and irreverence to the
King; and which General Hawley, as was his duty,
had brought to him within an hour after receiving
it.</p>

<p>At last opened the solemnity of the scene! the
Chancellor’s hackneyed sophistries, the Bishop of
Gloucester’s pedantic scorn, and the Duke of Newcastle’s
incongruous volubility, were rightly judged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
or foreseen to want a proper weight on so serious
an occasion. To raise the comely pompous dignitaries
of the Cabinet Council, and make them break
their long mystic silence in favour of the accused,
was a resource that did honour to the policy, as it
effectually did the business, of the secret junto. The
Duke of Marlborough first, and then the Archbishop,
rose and gave short accounts of their having
fully agreed in the sentence and report of the
Council. Lord Waldegrave, with decency and
spirit, commended Stone, spoke highly of the young
Prince, and added, that he would not act a moment
longer as Governor, than he should find Mr. Stone
a man of honour, principles, and integrity. Dr.
Hay Drummond, Bishop of St. Asaph, and brother
of Lord Duplin, made a very elegant and eloquent
speech in behalf of the accused. The Marquis of
Hartington and the Duke of Dorset gave their testimonials,
like the two former,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> to the acts of the
Cabinet Council. Lord Granville added to his,
“That innocence was no defence against temporary
clamour; it will blow over: but I don’t like Mr.
Stone’s desiring to have it heard any farther; it
would be making ourselves an inquisition. Some
often accuse others, to come at a third person. I
love my Lord Harcourt for what he said.” The
Duke of Grafton, too, bore his testimony.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>
<p>The Duke of Bedford rose again, and said, that
if he had been angry, he had had time to cool: and
must say, on the utmost deliberation, and with
the greatest attention to what he had heard, that
he had not found sufficient reason to acquit the
accused persons, and for this strong reason,
amongst others, that it remains evident that the
Bishop of Gloucester had tampered with Fawcett&mdash;do
the innocent tamper with evidence? as little
could he agree with the Duke of Newcastle, who
said he would be guilty to be so acquitted by
the Chancellor&mdash;Newcastle interrupting him, that
he had only said, he would be suspected; the
Duke of Bedford rejoined, that when his Grace
had gone so far, it was no wonder if he had gone
a little farther; but so far from agreeing even to
that modification, he would not be suspected by
one man, to be acquitted by that whole House.
That, when he had been of the Cabinet Council,
he had never known such a thing as their sitting
on a trial. That the Duke of Newcastle had told
them almost the whole examination; what can
induce their Lordships still to refuse to ask for
it? That he had been particularly called upon to
make this Motion; that the nation demands it;
that the very Parliament of Paris would go into
such an examination. That if any, in so high
a trust as the care of the Prince of Wales, are
suspected, can it be called a point of domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
concern only? can it be deemed so domestic as to
forbid public inquiry? That he must still urge
that Fawcett had never prevaricated, till the Bishop
had been with him&mdash;but if his Lordship is really
desirous of purging himself of this charge, let him
promote this Motion: here he will be sure of the
most impartial trial, of the most open, and consequently
of the most satisfactory acquittal. “To
prompt witnesses to prevaricate&mdash;to stifle inquiry&mdash;these
arts will not quiet the suspicions of mankind.
A more manly way it had been to have said, we did
drink these healths, we were as Jacobite as it is
pretended we were, but we are converted&mdash;but, my
Lords,” concluded the Duke, “it is not to prove
that these healths were drunk that I contend&mdash;if
any part of the charge is true, more is true.”</p>

<p>Lord Bath objected to any farther examination of
a man who had so prevaricated with the Cabinet
Council, whose proceedings, he said, were not only
sufficient, but not unprecedented. That he had
once been examined so himself, with Sir Paul
Methuen and Mr. Cholmondeley, and that they had
been examined separately; it was in relation to one
Lewis, a clerk to Lord Oxford, who, by mistake for
one Levi, a Jew, had been suspected of negotiations
with the Court of St. Germains: it was in the
Queen’s time, and she had referred it to the Cabinet
Council.</p>

<p>Lord Northumberland perceiving it was a day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
for great men to stand forth, thought it a good opportunity
to announce his own dignity; but he
said little to the purpose. Still less was said by
the young Marquis of Rockingham, though he had
prepared a long quotation from Tacitus about
informers; and opened with it.</p>

<p>The Duke of Argyle sneered at Ministers out of
place&mdash;not at future Ministers, for he was profuse
in flattery to Stone, who, till lately, he had never
heard had an enemy! that, during the Rebellion,
happening to be at the Secretary’s office, two men
came to solicit Mr. Stone for a place; the refused
went away the better pleased of the two, from Mr.
Stone’s gracious manner of refusing!</p>

<p>Lord Anson bore his testimony to the unanimity
and report of the Cabinet Council. Dr. Madox, of
Worcester, ungraciously and rudely said, that
though it might be right to countenance converts,
yet would it be wrong to entrust the whole to one,
who had been a Jacobite. That there were great
dissatisfactions already: what would ensue, if a
Star-chamber were erected to protect the most unpopular?
why not remove Mr. Stone to any other
employment? let him come and take his place
among your Lordships. He added, that great
would be the hardship on Fawcett, if tried in
Westminster-hall; for what Jury but would be
influenced by the authority and decision of the
Council? Lord Holderness notified his assent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
the proceedings of the Cabinet Council. The Bishop
of Worcester and Lord Sandys had some jarring;
and then Lord Ravensworth put a period to this
solemn mummery, in which he had acted such
various parts, by saying that he was satisfied
with his acquittal; that he thought nothing farther
necessary to his honour; would take no
farther part; did not desire anybody else would;
would leave it here&mdash;and went away! A silence
of confusion ensued for some minutes; nobody
rising to speak, the Duke of Bedford, Lord
Townshend, Lord Harcourt, and the Bishop of
Worcester, went below the bar to divide, and the
Bishop of Norwich was going; but no more following,
they gave it up without telling the House;
all the Tory Lords keeping their seats to vote for
Stone and Murray.</p>

<p>About this time was taken in Scotland, Dr. Archibald
Cameron, a man excepted by the Act of Indemnity.
Intelligence had been received some
time before of his intended journey to Britain,
with a commission from Prussia to offer arms to the
disaffected Highlanders, at the same time that
ships were hiring in the north to transport men.
The fairness of Dr. Cameron’s character, compared
with the severity he met from a Government,
most laudably mild to its enemies, confirmed this
report. That Prussia, who opened its inhospitable
arms to every British Rebel, should have tampered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
in such a business was by no means improbable.
That King hated his uncle&mdash;but could a Protestant
Potentate dip in designs for restoring a Popish
Government?&mdash;of what religion is policy? to what
sect is royal revenge bigoted? The Queen-dowager,
though sister of our King, was avowedly a
Jacobite, by principle so&mdash;and it was natural: what
Prince but the single one who profits by the principle
can ever think it allowable to overturn sacred
hereditary right? It is the cause of sovereigns that
their crimes should be unpunishable. Two sloops
were stationed to watch; yet Cameron landed; and
was taken with difficulty: an officer and ten men
pursued him: they divided&mdash;yet wherever they
turned, they found children posted, who ran swiftly
and screamed to give notice. At last they overtook
a boy who had hurt his foot; and by him were
directed to a house in a wood; yet the Doctor was
gone; but, on the wood being surrounded, was
taken.</p>

<p>By the very loyal, consequences equally threatening
were feared from a new amour of the King of
France, who had taken a mistress of Irish extraction,
the daughter of a shoemaker, formerly a life-guardsman:
her name, Murphy, and of signal
beauty. Madame Pompadour was a friend to peace
and England. This deviation in the Monarch’s
constancy was, however, of transitory duration.
With scarce complaisance, with no affection, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
for many years confined himself to his homely,
elderly, unattractive queen. All the intrigues of a
gallant Court, or of interested factions, had not
been able to undermine his conjugal regularity, for
it was no more. Accident threw him into the
arms of Madame de Mailly, a sensible woman, a
fine figure, but very plain; he demanded not beauty,
and became as regular as with the Queen. To
engage him more, that is, to govern him, Madame
de Mailly associated to their suppers her sister,
Madame de Vintimille, a woman of great wit, but
exceedingly ill-proportioned with beauty&mdash;a great
oversight in an ugly woman, who had dispossessed
an ugly one. The coadjutrix soon displaced her
introductress; but died in labour; of poison, as the
state of intrigues would of course suppose. The
Monarch hankered about the same family, and took
a third sister, who was gloriously beautiful, and
whom he created Duchesse de Chateauroux. In the
triumph of her concubinage, the King fell ill at
Metz. Fitz-James, Bishop of Soissons, attacked a
frightened piety, which was natural, and only subdued
by constitution. The mistress was not only
discarded, but publicly affronted, the Monarch permitting
it; and the Queen, who was sent for, made
a foolish triumphal entry to thank the Lord for the
recovery of the King’s soul and body&mdash;but as soon
as the latter was re-established, the Queen was sent
to her prayers, the Bishop to his diocese, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Duchess was recalled&mdash;but died suddenly. Though
a jealous sister may be supposed to dispatch a rival,
can one believe that Bishops and Confessors poison?</p>

<p>Madame Pompadour, the wife of a Fermier
General, succeeded: grace, beauty, address, art,
ambition, all met in that charming woman. She
governed him more than he had ever been governed
but by Cardinal Fleury: she engaged in all politics,
she gave life and agreeableness to all; she amassed
vast treasures herself, she was the cause of squandering
vast treasures, in varying scenes of pleasure
to divert the gloom of a temper which was verging
nearer to the age of devotion. The Clergy hated
her, for she countenanced the Parliament; the
people imputed oppressions to her; the Dauphin,
who was a bigot, and who loved his mother, affected
to shock her: yet the King, who was the best father
in the world, bore with great mildness so unpleasant
an attack on royal and parental authority.</p>

<p>The session of Parliament was languishing towards
a conclusion, when a Bill sent down from the
Lords to the Commons, and which had passed
almost without notice through the former House,
having been carried by an hundred Lords against
the Duke of Bedford and eleven others, raised, or
gave occasion to raise, extraordinary heats. This
was the famous <em>Marriage Bill</em>; an Act of such
notoriety, and on which so very much was said at
the time, and on which so much has been written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
since, that it would be almost impossible, at least
very wearisome, to particularize the Debates, and
very unnecessary to enter much into the state of
the question. Some of the most particular passages,
such as tend to illustrate or explain the characters,
the politics, and the factions of the time, I
shall, according to my custom, succinctly touch.</p>

<p>The Bill had been originally moved by my Lord
Bath, who, attending a Scotch cause, was struck
with the hardship of a matrimonial case, in which
a man, after a marriage of thirty years, was claimed
by another woman on a pre-contract. The Judges
were ordered to frame a Bill that should remedy so
cruel a retrospect. They did; but drew it so ill,
and it was three times printed so inaccurately, that
the Chancellor was obliged to give it ample correction.
Whether from mere partiality to an ordinance
thus become his own, or whether in shaping
a law, new views of power opened to a mind fond
of power, fond of dictating; so it was, that the
Chancellor gave all his attention to a statute into
which he had breathed the very spirit of aristocracy
and insolent nobility. It was amazing, in a country
where liberty gives choice, where trade and money
confer equality, and where facility of marriage had
always been supposed to produce populousness,&mdash;it
was amazing to see a law promulged, that cramped
inclination, that discountenanced matrimony, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
that seemed to annex as sacred privileges to birth,
as could be devised in the proudest, poorest little
Italian principality; and as if the artificer had
been a Teutonic Margrave, not a little lawyer, who
had raised himself by his industry from the very
lees of the people; and who had matched his own
blood with the great house of <em>Kent</em>!</p>

<p>The abuse of pre-contracts had occasioned the
demand of a remedy&mdash;the physician immediately
prescribed medicines for every ailment to which the
ceremony of marriage was or could be supposed
liable! Publication of banns was already an established
ordinance, but totally in disuse except
amongst the inferior people, who did not blush to
obey the law. Persons of Quality, who proclaimed
every other step of their conjugation by the most
public parade, were ashamed to have the intention
of it notified, and were constantly married by
special licence. Unsuitable matches in a country
where the passions are not impetuous, and where it
is neither easy nor customary to tyrannize the inclinations
of children, were by no means frequent:
the most disproportioned alliances, those contracted
by age, by dowagers, were without the scope of this
Bill. Yet the new Act set out with a falsehood,
declaiming against clandestine marriages, as if they
had been a frequent evil.</p>

<p>The greatest abuse were the temporary weddings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
clapped up in the Fleet, and by one Keith,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> who
had constructed a very Bishopric for revenue in
Mayfair, by performing that charitable function for
a trifling sum, which the <em>poor</em> successors of the
Apostles are seldom humble enough to perform out
of duty. The new Bill enjoined indispensable publication
of banns, yet took away their validity, if
parents, nay, if even guardians, signified their dissent,
where the parties should be under age&mdash;a very
novel power!&mdash;but guardians are a limb of Chancery!
The Archbishop’s licence was indeed reserved
to him. A more arbitrary spirit was still
behind: persons solemnizing marriages, without
these previous steps, were sentenced to transportation,
and the marriage was to be effectually null&mdash;so
close did congenial law clip the wings of the
prostrate priesthood! And as if such rigour did
not sufficiently describe its fountain and its destination,
it was expressly specified, that where a
mother or a guardian should be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non compos</i>, resort
might be had to the Chancellor himself for licence.
Contracts and pre-contracts, other flowers of ecclesiastic
prerogative, were to be totally invalid, and
their obligations abolished: and the gentle institution
was wound up with the penalty of death for all
forgeries in breach of this statute of modern Draco.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Quakers, Jews, and the Royal Family had the only
toleration.</p>

<p>May 14th.&mdash;The Bill came down to the Commons.
Nugent took it to pieces severely and sensibly,
pointed out the impropriety of it in a commercial
nation, and the ill-nature and partiality of
the restrictions. He showed himself a great master
of political disquisitions, and it seemed that a desire
of displaying that learning was the sole cause
of any opposition to the Bill. This was all that
passed material the first day, and the Bill was read
on a majority of 116 to 55.</p>

<p>21st.&mdash;A second adversary appeared against the
Bill. This was Charles Townshend, second son of
my Lord Townshend, a young man of unbounded
ambition, of exceeding application, and, as it now
appeared, of abilities capable of satisfying that ambition,
and of not wanting that application: yet to
such parts and such industry he was fond of associating
all the little arts and falsehoods that always
depreciate, though so often thought necessary by, a
genius. He had been an early favourite of Lord
Halifax, and had already distinguished himself on
affairs of trade, and in drawing plans and papers
for that province; but not rising in proportion to
his ambition, he comforted himself with employing
as many stratagems as had ever been imputed to
the most successful statesmen.</p>

<p>His figure was tall and advantageous, his action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
vehement, his voice loud, his laugh louder. He had
art enough to disguise anything but his vanity. He
spoke long and with much wit, and drew a picture,
with much humour at least, if not with much
humility, of himself and of his own situation, as
the younger son of a capricious father, who had
already debarred him from an advantageous match:
“were new shackles to be forged to keep young men
of abilities from mounting to a level with their
elder brothers?” Nugent had not shone with more
parts the preceding day; Nugent on no day discovered
less modesty. What will be their fates I
know not; but this Mr. Townshend and Mr. Conway
seemed marked by nature for leaders, perhaps
for rivals in the Government of their country. The
quickness of genius is eminently with the first, and
a superiority of application; the propriety and
amiableness of character with the latter. One
grasps at fortune, the other only seems pleased to
accept fortune when it advances to him. The one
foresees himself equal to everything, the other finds
himself so whenever he essays. Charles Townshend
seems to have no passion but ambition; Harry
Conway not even to have that. The one is impetuous
and unsteady; the other, cool and determined.
Conway is indolent, but can be assiduous;
Charles Townshend can only be indefatigable. The
latter would govern mankind for his own sake; the
former, for theirs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>The speeches hitherto had only been flourishes in
the air: at last the real enemy came forth, Mr. Fox;
who neither spared the Bill nor the author of it, as
wherever he laid his finger, it was not wont to be
light. He was supported by Fazakerley and Sir
William Yonge. Mr. Pelham, the Attorney and
Solicitor, Lord Hilsborough, Hampden, and Lord
Egmont, supported the Bill, and it was carried that
day by 165 to 84.</p>

<p>On the 23rd and 25th, the House sat late each
day on the Bill, Mr. Fox attacking and Mr. Pelham
defending with eager peevishness. The former repeated
his censures on the Chancellor, which old
Horace Walpole reproved; Nugent was absurd;
and the measure growing ministerial, the numbers
against the Bill diminished.</p>

<p>28th.&mdash;The Committee sat till half an hour past
three in the morning, on the clause for annulling
marriages that should be contracted contrary to the
inhibitions in the Bill. The Churchmen acquiesced
in the Legislature’s assuming this power in spirituals,
as they had done in the single case of the
young King’s marriage in the Regency Bill: but
however commendable the moderation of the Clergy
might be, the Pontific power arrogated by the head
of the Law, and his obstinate persisting to enforce
a statute, by no means calculated or called for by
general utility, was most indecent. The Speaker
argued with great weight against the clause; Wilbraham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
well for it. Mr. Fox, at one in the morning,
spoke against it for above an hour, and laid
open the chicanery and jargon of the Lawyers, the
pride of their Mufti, and the arbitrary manner of
enforcing the Bill. A motion for adjournment was
moved, but was rejected by above 80 to 40 odd.</p>

<p>30th.&mdash;The Committee went upon the clause
that gave unheard-of power, in the first resort to
parents and guardians, and then to the Chancery,
on the marriages of minors. Fox spoke with increasing
spirit against this clause too; and on Wilbraham’s
having said, if you have a sore leg, will
you not try gentle remedies first? he drew a most
severe picture of the Chancellor, under the application
of the story of a Gentlewoman at Salisbury,
who, having a sore leg, sent for a Country Surgeon,
who pronounced it must be cut off. The Gentlewoman,
unwilling to submit to the operation, sent
for another, more merciful, who said he could save
her leg, without the least operation. The Surgeons
conferred: the ignorant one said, “I know it might
be saved, but I have given my opinion; my character
depends upon it, and we must carry it
through”&mdash;the leg was cut off. Charles Yorke, the
Chancellor’s son, took this up with great anger, and
yet with preciseness, beginning with these words,
“It is new in Parliament, it is new in politics, it is
new in ambition;” and drew a lofty character of his
father, and of the height to which he had raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
himself by his merit; concluding with telling Fox,
how imprudent it was to attack such authority, and
assuring him that he would feel it. Mr. Fox replied
with repeating the sententious words: “Is it new
in Parliament to be conscientious? I hope not! Is
it new in politics? I am afraid it is! Is it new in
ambition? It certainly is, to attack such authority!”
Mr. Pelham answered him well. Mr. Fox once more
replied, urging how cruel and absurd it was to force
the Bill down: that he knew he should not be heard
by above one-third of the House, but would speak
so loud that he would be heard out of the House.
That from the beginning to the end of the Bill, one
only view had predominated, that of pride and aristocracy.
There was much of truth in this. At the
very beginning, on the Duke of Newcastle’s declining
to vote in the Bill, the Chancellor told
Mr. Pelham, “I will be supported in this, or I
never will speak for you again.” As the Opposition
had at that time been inconsiderable, this
breathed a little more than a mere spirit of obstinacy,
and foretold a Bill to be framed not without
an interested meaning: at least a legislator is uncommonly
zealous for the public good, who forgets
the philosophy of his character to drive on his
honest ordinances by political menaces!</p>

<p>The next day the Committee finished without a
division. Sir Richard Lloyd, a Lawyer, who had
spoken against the Bill, voted for it afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
without assigning any reason for his change of
opinion. Captain Saunders, who had said that
he would go and vote against the Bill, for the
sake of the sailors, having once given forty of his
crew leave to go on shore for an hour, and all
returned married, was compelled by Lord Anson,
the Chancellor’s son-in-law and his patron, to vote
for it. Henley and the Solicitor-General declaring
of the same words, the one, that they could not be
made clearer; the other, that they were as clear as
the sun at noonday, though each gave a totally
different interpretation of them, were well ridiculed
by Fox; as a serious speech of Lord Egmont was
with much humour and not a little indecency by
Nugent.</p>

<p>June 1.&mdash;The report was made of the Bill, and
the House sat till ten. On one clause only there
was a division of 102 to 20.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: '2.--A '">2d.&mdash;A </ins>new anti-ministerial Paper appeared,
called the Protester, supported at the expense of
the Duke of Bedford and Beckford, and written by
Ralph, a dull author, originally a poet, and satirized
in the Dunciad: retained, after his pen had been
rejected by Sir Robert Walpole, by Doddington and
Waller; but much fitter to range the obscure
ideas of the latter, than to dress up the wit of the
former: from them, he devolved to the Prince of
Wales in his second opposition, and laboured
long in a paper called the Remembrancer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
which was more than once emboldened above
the undertaker’s pitch, by Lord Egmont and
others. Ralph’s own turn seemed to be endeavouring
to raise mobs by speculative ideas of government;
from whence his judgment at least may be
calculated. But he had the good fortune to be
bought off from his last Journal, the Protester, for
the only Paper that he did not write in it.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;The Marriage Bill was read for the last
time. Charles Townshend again opposed it with
as much argument as before with wit. Mr. Fox,
with still more wit, ridiculed it for an hour and a
half. Notwithstanding the Chancellor’s obstinacy
in maintaining it, and the care he had bestowed
upon it, it was still so incorrect and so rigorous,
that its very body-guards had been forced to make
or to submit to many amendments: these were
inserted in Mr. Fox’s copy in red ink: the Solicitor-General,
who sat near him as he was speaking,
said, “How bloody it looks!” Fox took this up
with spirit, and said, “Yes, <em>but you cannot say
I did it; look what a rent the learned Casca
made</em>, (this alluded to the Attorney,) <em>through this
the well-beloved Brutus stabbed</em>!” (Mr. Pelham)&mdash;however,
he finished with earnest declarations of
not having designed to abuse the Chancellor, and
with affirming that it was scandalous to pass the
Bill&mdash;but it was passed by 125 votes to 56.</p>

<p>6th.&mdash;The Bill being returned to the Lords, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
amendments were read. The Duke of Bedford, who
began to attack the whole Bill, was obstructed by
the Chancellor, who would have confined him to
the mere amendments; but the Duke, appealing to
the House whether he might not argue against the
face of the whole Bill as it now stood, the Chancellor
seemed to acquiesce; but the Duke, not finding
any disposition to support him, soon dropped the
cause; objecting chiefly to the last clause on not
extending the act to Foreign Countries. The
Chancellor replied, that he was sorry the clause
was there; but the Bill was too good to be lost, and
might have much good engrafted on it hereafter.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
Lord Sandys declared that he would agree to all the
amendments made by the House of Commons,
against any that should be offered by any body else.
An absurd declaration, founded on the design of
proroguing the Parliament on the morrow, which
would leave no time for returning the Bill to the
Commons; and a plain indication of the indigested
manner in which a law of such importance was hurried
on. On its being urged that several women
could not write, the Bishop of Oxford, with a
sophistry that would have distinguished him in <em>any</em>
church, replied that the Clergyman might write to
himself, and give it to the woman, and she to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
again, for that the Bill did not say, that when she
gave her consent in writing, it must be of her own
writing! Lord Bath said, the opposition had proceeded
from faction and party. The Duke of Bedford
replied, that his opposition had arisen from
conscience, that he had not troubled himself about
what the House of Commons did; yet he had perceived
that the Bill had been crammed down both
Houses.</p>

<p>At last the Chancellor&mdash;not, as he has been
represented,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> in the figure of <em>Public Wisdom
speaking</em>, but with all the acrimony of wounded
pride, of detected ambition, and insolent authority.
He read his speech; not that he had written it to
guard himself from indecency; or that he had feared
to forget his thread of argument in the heat of personality:
he did not deign an argument, he did
not attempt to defend a Bill so criticized. He
seemed only to have methodized his malice, and
noted down the passages where he was to resent,
where to threaten. He introduced himself with
just allowing conscience and candour to the Duke
of Bedford; but what he had to complain of had
passed without those walls, and in another place.
That, as to the young man, (Charles Townshend,)
youth and parts require beauty and riches, flesh
and blood inspire such thoughts, and therefore he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
excused him&mdash;but men of riper years and graver
had opposed; that the first, (the Speaker,) was a
good, well-meaning man, but had been abused by
words&mdash;that another, (Fox,) dark, gloomy, and insidious
genius, who was an engine of personality and
faction, had been making connexions, and trying to
form a party, but his designs had been seen through
and defeated. That in this country you must
govern by force or by law; it was easy to know
that person’s principles, which were to govern by
arbitrary force. That the King speaks through the
Seals, and is represented by the Chancellor and
the Judges in the Courts where the Majesty of the
King resides; that such attacks on the Chancellor
and the Law was flying in the face of the King:
that this behaviour was not liked: that it had been
taken up with dignity,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> and that the incendiary had
been properly reproved; that this was not the way
to popularity or favour; and that he could take
upon him to say, that person knows so by this
time; a beam of light had broken in upon him;
but, concluded he, I despise his scurrility, as much
as his adulation and retraction. This <em>Philippic</em>
over, the Bill passed. Lord Granville, who had
threatened to oppose it, did not attend.</p>

<p>The prorogation of the Parliament prevented any
farther open war. Mr. Fox seemed wantonly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
unnecessarily to have insulted the Chancellor, and
had even manifested some fear at having done so.
Indeed, he who had always been rash and resolute,
now first discovered some symptoms of irresolution;
and the time advanced but too fast, when the provocation
offered to Yorke, and the suspicion of his
want of a determined spirit, were of essential detriment
to him. He could not but feel the Chancellor’s
haughty scorn of the atonement he had offered;
yet, though he let slip both sentences of resentment
and indications of an ambition that began to
aspire higher, he soon yielded to a silent pacification.
Mr. Pelham affected to be rather ignorant of
the heights to which the rupture had openly been
carried; and on the King’s being told, that Mr. Fox’s
behaviour had been concerted with the Duke of
Bedford, Mr. Pelham protested to Fox, that he had
assured the King that the latter, on some proposal
of union about elections from that Duke, had refused
any such connexion while he should remain in the
King’s service. For the storm between Fox and
the Chancellor, Mr. Pelham said it would blow over,
“Yet neither of you,” said he to the former, “will
forgive.” Mr. Fox, in return, who gave no credit
to this affected candour, reproached him in strong
terms with the Chancellor’s (and by necessary implication,
with the Duke of Newcastle’s) treachery
to Sir Robert Walpole.</p>

<p>The Duke’s conversation on this occasion with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
Mr. Fox was remarkable. “The Chancellor meaned
me,” said he, “by arbitrary force.” Mr. Fox
thought not. “Why,” said the Duke, “do you
think that he imagines you would govern by an
Army without me?” “Sir,” said Fox, “how will
the King act on what has happened?” “The
King,” replied the Duke, “would part with you,
or even with me, to satisfy them: but if you
can maintain yourself for six months, he will
like you the better for what has passed, for he
thinks you a man, and he knows none of the
rest have the spirit of a mouse.” Mr. Fox
said, “If they turn me out, I shall not acquit
Mr. Pelham, nor shall I spare him. Let him raise
up Murray; Mr. Pelham knows he has betrayed
him, but is willing to forget it. I know he
fears me still more; he has often told me I was
like Mr. Pulteney. It may be vanity, but if I am
stronger than Murray, I am ten times stronger
than Mr. Pelham.” “Mr. Pelham,” replied the
Duke, “has neither candour, honour, nor sincerity.
Fox, how do you think I have been entertaining
myself this morning? It was poor pleasure, but I
had no better. The Duke of Newcastle asked me
how I would have the warrant for Cranborn<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
drawn. I thanked him, but heard Mr. Pelham was
uneasy that I had not thanked him; so to-day I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
met them together, and thanked the Duke of Newcastle
again, and only asked t’other when he went
to Esher.” The Duke concluded with advising Fox
to speak to the King, and not let him brood on it:
“He will talk on the Bill,” said the Duke: “let
him; and you, who could not be convinced in the
House, be convinced by him.”</p>

<p>The King was civil to Fox at his next levee:
afterwards in his closet Mr. Fox beginning to say,
“Sir, last Wednesday the Chancellor”&mdash;the King
interrupted, “Oh! sir, I believe you had given him
cause; it is now pretty even.” Mr. Fox said,
“Sir, I shall only beg to be heard as to there
being any faction or intrigue in my behaviour: I
give you my honour it is not true.” “The moment
you give me your honour,” replied the King, “I
believe you; but I must tell you, as I am no liar,
that you have been much suspected.” He then
repeated to him accusations of such low caballing,
of balls given at Holland House to the Duchess
of Bedford, to which Mr. Pelham’s daughters had
not been invited, of persons who were disagreeable
to the Pelhams being invited; in short, accusations
of such feminine and peevish trifles, that if
Mr. Pelham was not the whisperer of them, and
the Chancellor was, the latter had certainly very
tender sensations, when they could extend themselves
to the dancing disgusts of his friend’s wife
and daughters! Mr. Fox answered these cursorily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
disclaimed any political connexions with the Bedfords,
and repeated with emphasis, “Such intrigues,
Sir, would be worse in me, while in your service,
than in any man living, as nobody blamed such intrigues
in those who undermined Sir Robert Walpole
so much as I.” This dialogue ended so well, that
Mr. Fox asked for a little place for one of his
dependents, and obtained it.</p>

<p>7th.&mdash;Dr. Archibald Cameron suffered death at
Tyburn. He had been forced into the Rebellion by
his brother Lochiel, whom he had tried to confine,
to prevent his engaging in it: not that Lochiel had
taken arms voluntarily: he was a man of great
parts, but could not resist the desperate honour
which he thought the Pretender did him, in throwing
himself into his arms, and demanding his sword
and interest.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> The Doctor, who was a man of
learning and very valuable humanity, which he had
displayed in endeavours to civilize that part of a
barbarous country, and in offices of benevolence to
the soldiers employed on the Highland roads, and
to the mine-adventurers established at Strontean,
was torn from these sweet duties, from his profession,
from a beloved and large family, and attended
his rash brother at Prestonpans and Falkirk,
escaped with him, and was appointed physician to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
Lochiel’s regiment in the French service. He ventured
back, was taken as mentioned above, and
underwent a forced death with as much composure
as a philosopher could affect at dying a natural
one.</p>

<p>During the course of the summer the troubles in
Ireland increased. Lord Kildare returned thither
towards the end of June, after having presented a
Memorial to the King against the administration
of the Duke of Dorset, and the ascendant of the
Primate. Nothing could be worse drawn: he was
too weak to compose better, and too obstinate to
submit to any correction. No facts were alleged
against the Lord Lieutenant, nor any crime pretended
in the Primate but that he was a Churchman.
Yet these no accusations, he told the King
he would return to prove whenever he should be
required, and would answer that the Irish House
of Commons would stand by him. He had no experience;
nor knew that many men will say with
party heat what they will not support with party
steadiness. Lord Holderness, by the King’s command,
wrote to the Chancellor of Ireland, telling
him, that the King had sent the Duke of Dorset to
govern them, because he had pleased them so much
formerly, and because he had the good of Ireland
so much at heart: that his Majesty wondered at
any man taking upon himself to answer for a
nation; and that he expected that all who loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
him would support the Lord Lieutenant: that his
Majesty permitted this letter to be communicated
to Lord Kildare, to anybody. Thus the absurdity
of the Memorial was balanced by the haughtiness
of the mandate. Lord Kildare had transfused into
a State Manifesto the most licentious topics of
party libels: the English Ministers adopted, in the
King’s answer, the most exalted diction of French
prerogative.</p>

<p>Whatever might be the temper in Ireland, the
increasing servility in England encouraged such a
spirit in the Court. Mr. Pelham, who went to
Scarborough this summer for his health, received
the extravagant and unprecedented compliment of
being desired to recommend a member to that
borough, which happened to be vacant. The people
of Bristol proceeded so far as to offer the same
nomination to the King himself on this occasion:
riots had happened there on the erection of new
turnpikes; a citizen knocked down one of the
rioters, and another stabbed him. The jury brought
it in wilful murder in the first. The Attorney-General
moved in the King’s Bench to reverse the
judgment. This so pleased both parties in that city
(the condemned person being a chief Tory), that
they acknowledged it by this offer, so repugnant to
all ideas of freedom of elections. What followed
was only ridiculous. The King recommended
Nugent: the Bristol men begged to be excused, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Nugent had been the principal promoter<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> of the
Bill for a General Naturalization.</p>

<p>Some little time before the Irish Parliament met,
the Speaker’s friends gave out, that the Primate
had made acknowledgments to him of his concern
for the confusion that was likely to follow, that he
would meddle no more with the House of Commons,
but would give all his interest and influence there
to the Speaker: that the latter had replied, the
Primate had such underhand ways, and had deceived
him so often, that he could not trust him;
and for his influence he despised it. All this passed
by the intervention of Luke Gardiner, who, on the
Primate’s party denying it, being called on, avowed
the message. However, as it was decent for the
Speaker to act candour and contrition too, he went
to the Duke of Dorset, and told him, that he had
got a majority in the House of Commons, and that
they were determined to omit in the Address to the
King the usual thanks for sending his Grace; and
that if his Grace would acquiesce in that omission,
they would make the rest of the session easy to him.
The Duke, as hardhearted as the Speaker had been
to the Primate, would by no means give his own
consent to being stigmatized. An hour before he
went to open the Parliament, the Speaker returned
and acquainted him that he had prevailed on his
friends to suffer the usual Address&mdash;and it was
made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>The English Parliament, which opened on the
15th of November, was employed till the end of
the year in an affair which showed how much the
age, enlightened as it is called, was still enslaved
to the grossest and most vulgar prejudices. The
year before an Act had passed for naturalizing Jews.
It had passed almost without observation, Sir John
Barnard and Lord Egmont having merely given a
languid opposition to it, in order to reingratiate
themselves with the mobs of London and Westminster.
The Bishops had honestly concurred in
removing such absurd distinctions, as stigmatized
and shackled a body of the most loyal, commercial,
and wealthy subjects of the kingdom. A new
general election was approaching; some obscure
men, who perhaps wanted the necessary sums for
purchasing seats, or the topics of party to raise
clamour, had fastened on this Jew Bill; and in a
few months the whole nation found itself inflamed
with a Christian zeal, which was thought happily
extinguished with the ashes of Queen Anne and
Sacheverel. Indeed, this holy spirit seized none but
the populace and the very lowest of the Clergy:
yet all these grew suddenly so zealous for the
honour of the prophecies that foretell calamity and
eternal dispersion to the Jews, that they seemed to
fear lest the completion of them should be defeated
by Act of Parliament: and there wanted nothing
to their ardour but to petition both Houses to enact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
the accomplishment. The little Curates preached
against the Bishops for deserting the interests of
the Gospel; and Aldermen grew drunk at county
clubs in the cause of Jesus Christ, as they had used
to do for the sake of King James. Yet to this
senseless clamour did the Ministry give way; and
to secure tranquillity to their elections, submitted to
repeal the Bill.</p>

<p>It is worth while to recapitulate some instances
of the capriciousness of the times. An inglorious
peace had been made, and the first hostages imposed
that ever this country gave: not a murmur
followed. The Regency Bill, with the tremendous
clause of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">præmunire</i>, had been passed without
occasioning a pamphlet. The Marriage Bill, that
bane of society, that golden grate that separates the
nobility from the plebeians, had not excited a complaint
from the latter. A trifling Bill, that opened
some inconsiderable advantages to a corps of men,
with whom we live, traffic, converse, could alarm
the whole nation&mdash;it did more: a cabal of Ministers,
who had insulted their master with impunity, who
had betrayed every ally and party with success,
and who had crammed down every Bill that was
calculated for their own power, yielded to transitory
noise, and submitted to fight under the banners of
prophecy, in order to carry a few more members in
another Parliament.</p>

<p>I shall be very brief on the Debates that attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
this repeal; the topic was foolish, the
chief speakers not considerable, the events not
memorable.</p>

<p>On the very day the Houses met, the Duke of
Newcastle moved to repeal the Bill, which, he said,
had only been a point of <em>political policy</em>. The
Bishop of Oxford undertook the apology of his
Bench, and (though in a manner too ironic) defended
them well, for having given way to a Bill,
which they had considered only in a political light,
had never much liked, and were glad to have
repealed, to quiet the minds of good people. Drummond
of St. Asaph, sensibly and in a more manly
style, urged that the Bishops could not have opposed
the Bill without indulging a spirit of persecution,
abhorrent from the spirit of the Gospel. Lord
Temple, with his accustomed warmth, opposed the
repeal, grew zealous for the honour of a Ministry
which he wanted to censure, and protested against
the Legislature listening to clamour, which was less
intended to serve the Protestant Religion, than to
wound the Protestant Succession. Loved he did
the Liberty of the Press, yet thought the abuse in
the Daily Papers ought to be noticed. He had
never listened to popular clamour, nor always
thought that the voice of the people was the voice
of God. That the approaching general election had
given foundation to this uproar, and therefore should
not have wondered at a repeal being consented to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
by the other House, but for the Lords to consent,
would be subscribing to the accusation. Lord
Temple was still more violent on the second reading;
pronounced the clamour disaffection clothed in
superstition, and a detestable high-church spirit:
trembled lest the Plantation Act should be repealed;
trembled lest fires should be rekindled in Smithfield
to burn Jews; shuddered at our exceeding the
heinous days of Charles the Second, who, though he
oppressed Presbyterians, encouraged Jews. That
to give way to this spirit, would invite persecution
against the Presbyterians. For him, he acted on
the principles on which he had been bred, had
lived, and would die. The Chancellor replied to
him with temper, and defended the measure of a
free government giving way. That the longer
Bills of Naturalization existed, the more difficult
they grow to repeal, as they have been hanging out
invitation to Foreigners to accept the advantages
of them: was earnest against any thought of repealing
the Plantation Act, which had subsisted thirteen
years, and allows seven years for settling: that as
Jews are chiefly concerned in remittances, it would
undo our colonies to repeal Bills made in favour of
that people.</p>

<p>On the 21st, the Duke of Bedford said he had
been against the Bill, and was now against the
repeal, which was an effect of the imbecility of the
Administration. Lord Temple again spoke against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
it, and well. Lord Granville with humour turned the
whole into ridicule; said he remembered many religious
Bills in which religion had nothing to do; they
were made or repealed from clamour. When the Schism
Bill passed, Lord Harcourt, then <em>not</em> Chancellor was
for it; afterwards against it, and then pleaded, that it
was only a Bill to make school-mistresses take the
Sacrament three times a year, and what was that to
Government? The Uniformity Bill was rejected
after being carried so high by party, that it was not
regarded whether a man was for peace or for war,
but whether he was for or against that Bill. That
it had been afterwards brought in by the Whigs to
gain a single Lord, Lord Nottingham; that when
it was objected that a persecuting Bill was surely
paying dear for one man, a grave Whig Lord
replied, “It is true; but let our friends be persecuted
sometimes, or they will not think they want
us.” That undictated by religion as those Bills
were, or the clamour against them, they breathed
the very essence of it, compared to this Jew Bill,
which, with its clamour, was the nothingness of a
nothing. Lord Temple commended the Bench, but
feared there might be Toryism lurking in some
corner of it; and then painted the Bishop of London,
who, he said, he had heard, was disposed to a
repeal even of the Plantation Act. He would not
suffer Jews even in that diocese<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> of his&mdash;he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
not know whether he ought strictly to call it his
diocese: the Plantations were subjected to his
Lordship’s pastoral jurisdiction; but perhaps he had
not taken out his patent; it might cost fourscore
or an hundred pounds! He talked again of
disaffection, and said he had been raking into
the London Evening Post, that Augæan stable of
filth and calumny&mdash;thus was Lord Temple at once
a zealous Whig, and scandalized at libels! Whigs
have not generally disliked libels, nor had he, but
it was when he was less Whig. The Bishop of Oxford
answered for his brother of London, and denied
that he was averse to the Plantation Act.
The Chancellor said, that the only imbecility of the
Administration was in tolerating such libels; that
the liberty of the Press could not give liberty to
print what a man may not write; that what a
man could not justify to do, he could not justify to
print; that he thought the libels on this Bill
ought to be prosecuted; that the Lords and Commons
might trust themselves with looking into the
licence of the Press.</p>

<p>22d.&mdash;On the third reading of the Bill, Lord
Temple made a very bad obscure speech; tried to
answer Lord Granville; tried to encourage the
Tories to continue the clamour; tried to excuse his
invective on the Bishop of London; but succeeded
in none of those points, and the repeal passed.</p>

<p>In Ireland, the new parties from personalities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
turned to matters of government. A Bill had been
prepared to enable them to dispose of an overplus
of the Revenue for the benefit of the kingdom;
and it was specified in the preamble that it was
with the King’s consent. The Opposition refused
to admit this preamble: the Castle were afraid to
proceed to a division, and suppressed the preamble,
but sent over the Bill, depending on the English
Ministry not suffering such a diminution of the prerogative.
The next day, on a trifling question
about some words relating to Neville Jones, the
Castle stood a division, and had a majority, though
but of three votes. As the parties were so equally
balanced, the animosities did not flag, but proceeded
to great extremities, both in the English manner of
abuse, and in the Irish of duels.</p>

<p>27th.&mdash;Lord Temple, after having mysteriously
summoned the Lords to an affair, as he told them,
of great importance, moved to have the Judges
asked, if Jews could purchase land, and whether it
would legally descend to their children. The Chancellor,
Lord Cholmondeley, Lord Granville, and the
Duke of Argyle opposing the Motion, and nobody
supporting it, Lord Temple gave it up.</p>

<p>The same day the repeal was agitated in the
other House; Northey proposed to have the words
in the preamble, <em>have taken occasion to raise
clamour</em>, altered to <em>have raised clamour</em>. He was
seconded by Prowse, Lord Egmont, and Admiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Vernon. On the other side Nugent, Sir W. Yonge,
Sir Richard Lloyd, Mr. Pelham, old Horace Walpole,
and Mr. Pitt, who was just come abroad again
after a year of sullen illness, defended the words
and the repeal, and it passed by a majority of 150
to 60.</p>

<p>28th.&mdash;Letters came from Ireland with an account
of the first Parliamentary victory obtained
there by the Opposition over the Court. Neville
Jones had been voted guilty of abuse in his office<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
by 124 to 116. The strangers in the gallery of the
House huzzaed; the city was crowded by the
triumphant mob. Lord Kildare, the popular hero,
was an hour passing to his own house at eleven at
night.</p>

<p>Dec. 4th.&mdash;A call of the House being appointed,
Lord Harley and Sir James Dashwood moved for a
repeal of the Plantation Act. Martin, the West
Indian, opposed the Motion in a speech of wit. He
said, this Act had been made thirteen years ago;
had occasioned no clamour then, nor since. Foreigners
would begin to think that there was no
combustible matter left in England but these poor
miserable Jews. One hundred and eighty-five have
taken the benefit of the Act. He had been so idle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
he said, as to read all the pamphlets and papers on
the late Act, and must pronounce that no subject
ever occasioned the spilling so much nonsense.
That America can only be peopled by Foreigners,
unless you would drain your own country, over and
above those valuable colonists, the transported.</p>

<p>Sir Roger Newdigate spoke for the last moved
repeal. Nugent ridiculed it, and said, that if once
the principle was admitted, there would be no
stopping. Why have 130 Jews been naturalized
in Jamaica, and none in Barbadoes? because three
parts of the former are desert, and no part of the
latter. Would you drive them out of the desert?
Spanish Jews are the most proper, because they can
best support the climate. That noble pirate, the
Knight of Malta, says, Make perpetual war with
perpetual enemies: so says the Inquisition&mdash;imitate
them&mdash;and you will only lose your Mediterranean
trade. Then break with those who league with the
enemies of your religion, as Spain does with Denmark<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>&mdash;but
no; you have done what you meaned
to do; stop here: a Christian knows no perpetual
enmity. The most prosperous, happy man here
has the best chance for the next world. They who
made this clamour, now smile with us; if we gave
way, would laugh at us.</p>

<p>Sir John Barnard made a short, bad speech, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
went away. Mr. Pelham said, to repeal the Plantation
Act would be to tell the people, We will
repeal this law, not because it has, but because it
ought to have made you uneasy. But it would
be too serious to pay such attention even to clamour:
who part with their wealth, part with their strength.
Such a repeal would revive the principle of the
Church, which has had such pernicious effects&mdash;but
no encouragement must be given to that spirit,
though it has been laboured by some who can only
figure in a hot contest, and who can thunder out
their ecclesiastic anathemas, but have nothing to
say when they come to preach on morality. Pitt
carried this still further; and though he did not act
like, yet he affected to speak with the same spirit of
Whiggism as his friend, Lord Temple. He had not
expected, he said, that this would be the first return
to Parliament for their condescension in repealing
the late act. Here the stand must be made, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">venit summa dies</i>! we should have a Church spirit
revived. He believed the late clamour was only a
little election art, which was given way to genteelly;
that the other Bill was not a toleration of, but a
preference given to, Jews over other sects. That
his maxim was, never to do more for the Church
than it now enjoys: that now you would except the
Jews in the opposite extreme. It is the Jew to-day,
it would be the Presbyterian to-morrow: we
should be sure to have a septennial Church clamour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
That we are not now to be influenced by old laws
enacted before the Reformation: our ancestors
would have said, “A Lollard has no right to inherit
lands.” But we do not fear indulging Jews; they
will never be great purchasers of land; they love
money, and trade with it to better advantage.
This silly effort of old prejudices was baffled by 208
to 88. Not that even eighty-eight men were
actuated by such monkish principles; some were
obliged to espouse them to secure their approaching
elections.</p>

<p>The heats in Ireland increased with the success
of the Opposition. The Speaker was adored by the
mob; they worshipped him under the name of
<em>Roger</em>. They made bonfires of reproach before the
door of the Primate: they stopped coaches, and
made them declare for England or Ireland. The
Hackney Chairmen distinguished their patriotism
by refusing to carry any fare to the Castle. A Dr.
Andrews of the Castle-faction, reproaching a Mr.
Lambert at the door of the House of Commons,
with forfeiting a promise of bringing him into Parliament,
and proceeding to a challenge, Lambert
said, “I will first go into the House, and vote
against that rascal Neville Jones.” Dr. Andrews
repeating the insult, Lambert went in and complained,
and Andrews was ordered into custody;
Carter, Master of the Rolls, saying, “What, would
that man force himself into a seat here! and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
what? only to prostitute his vote to a man,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> the
known enemy of this country! I need not name
him, you all know whom I mean.” Malone’s
brother, a rising young man, on Lord George’s imputing
the prosecution of Neville Jones to the rage
of party, said, “He did not believe there subsisted
any such thing; but if there did, it was more laudable
than threats, bribes, and promises, which that
Noble Lord had used to procure a majority.” The
accusation was not groundless; Sir James Hamilton,
a very indigent member, refused an offer from the
Castle of 2000<em>l.</em> and 200<em>l.</em> per annum for life.
Satires and claret were successful arms even against
corruption! The Money Bill was sent back from
England, with the preamble re-instated, but was
rejected in Ireland by a majority of five.</p>


<h3>1754.</h3>

<p>The new year began with orders sent to Ireland
to prorogue the Parliament, and to disgrace the
most obnoxious, at the discretion of the Lord-Lieutenant;
but the Duke was moderate. He contented
himself with obtaining an adjournment for three
weeks, and with displacing Carter, the Master of
the Rolls; Malone, Prime Serjeant, (a convert from
Popery), Dilks, Quarter-Master and Barrack-Master
General; and with stopping the pension of Bellingham
Boyle, Register of the Prerogative Court, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
a near relation of the Speaker. Andrew Stone was
inclined to temporize, but Murray counselled, and
drove on measures of authority.</p>

<p>February 7th.&mdash;Sir John Barnard, on the view
of the approaching elections, and their concomitant
perjury, moved to repeal the Bribery Oath; and
was seconded by Sir William Yonge. But the consideration
that the repeal would avow permission of
bribery prevailed over the certainty of bribery
heightened by perjury, and the Motion was rejected
without a division. In the other House, the next
day, the Bishop of Worcester had as little success in
another moral attempt: he moved for reformation
and a fast&mdash;in vain.</p>

<p>19th.&mdash;There was a Debate on the Bill for subjecting
to military law the troops going to the
East Indies; but it passed on a division of 245
to 50.</p>

<p>March 4th.&mdash;The Duke of Bedford offered a
Bill to postpone the activity of the Marriage Bill,
till it should be maturely considered and amended.
The Chancellor opposed it dictatorially; and it was
rejected by 56 Lords to 10.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These were the last occurrences in the life of
that fortunate Minister, Henry Pelham, who had
surmounted every difficulty, but the unhappiness of
his own temper. The fullness of his power had
only contributed to heighten his peevishness. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
supplied the deficiencies of genius by affected virtue;
he had removed superiors by treachery, and
those of whom he was jealous, by pretexting, or
administering to the jealousies of his brother: but
the little arts by which he had circumvented
greater objects, were not applicable even to his own
little passions. He enjoyed the plenitude of his
Ministry but a short time, and that short period
was a scene of fretfulness. He had made a journey
to Scarborough in the summer for scorbutic
complaints, but receiving little benefit from a short
stay, and being banqueted much on the road, he
returned with his blood more disordered. It produced
a dangerous boil, which was once thought
cured; but he relapsed on the third of March, and
died on the sixth, aged near sixty-one.</p>

<p>It would be superfluous to add much to the character
already given of him in the former part of
these memoirs. Thus much may be said with propriety:
his abilities, I mean, parliamentary, and his
eloquence cleared up, and shone with much greater
force, after his power was established. He laid
aside his doubling plausibility, which had at once
raised and depreciated him, and assumed a spirit
and authority that became him well. Considering
how much he had made it a point to be Minister,
and how much his partizans had proclaimed him
the only man worthy of being Minister, he ought
to have conferred greater benefits on his country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
He had reduced interest, and a part of the
National Debt; these were his services. He had
raised the name of the King, but he had wounded
his authority. He concluded an ignominious
peace; but the circumstances of the times made
it be thought, and perhaps it was, desirable.
The desertion of the King in the height of a
Rebellion, from jealousy of a man with whom he
soon after associated against some of the very men
who had deserted with him, will be a lasting blot
on his name&mdash;let it be remembered as long, that,
though he first taught or experienced universal
servility in Englishmen, yet he lived without
abusing his power, and died poor.</p>

<p>Having never proposed to write a regular history,
but to throw together some anecdotes and characters
which might cast a light on the times in which I
have lived, and might lead some future and more
assiduous historian to an intimate knowledge of the
men whose counsels or actions he shall record, I
had determined to lay down my pen at the death of
that Minister, whose fortune, situation, and genius
had superinduced a very new complexion over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
country, and who had composed a system of lethargic
acquiescence, in which the spirit of Britain, agitated
for so many centuries, seemed willingly to
repose. But as the numbness of that enchantment
has been dispelled by the evanition of the talisman,
though so many of its mischievous principles survive,
I shall once again endeavour to trace the
stream of events to their secret source, though
with a pen more unequal than ever to the task. A
Monkish writer may be qualified to record an age
of barbarity and ignorance; Sallust alone was
worthy to snatch the rapid episode of Catiline from
oblivion; Tacitus, to paint monsters whose lives
surpassed caricatura; Livy, to embrace whole ages
of patriots and heroes. Though no Catiline, I
trust, will rise in my pages, to deform his country
by his horrid glory; though our present minister,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
notwithstanding he has the monkey disposition of
Heliogabalus, is happily without his youth or lusts,
and by the character of the age that disposition is
systematized into little mischiefs and unbloody
treacheries; though we have no succession of incorrupt
senators; yet the times beginning to wear
in some lights a more respectable face, it will
require a steadier hand, and more dignified conceptions,
than served to seize and to sketch out the
littlenesses and trifles that had characterized the
foregoing period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>The style, therefore, of the following sheets will
perhaps wear a more serious aspect than I have
used before: yet shall I not check a smile now and
then at transient follies; nor, as much appropriated
as gravity is to an historian, can I conceive how
history can always be faithful, if always solemn. Is
a palace a perpetual shrine of virtue, or incessantly
a tribunal of severity? do not follies predominate
in mankind over either virtues or vices? and whoever
has been conversant in a Court, does he not
know how strongly the cast of it verges towards
ridiculous? Besides, I am no historian: I write
casual Memoirs; I draw characters; I preserve
anecdotes, which my superiors, the historians of
Britain, may enchase into their weighty annals, or
pass over at their pleasure. In one point I shall
not vary from the style I have assumed, but shall
honestly continue to relate the blemishes of material
personages as they enter upon the scene: and whoever
knows the interior of affairs, must be sensible
to how many more events the faults of statesmen
give birth, than are produced by their good intentions.</p>

<p>If I do not forbid myself censure, at least I shall
shun that frequent poison of histories, flattery.
How has it preponderated in most writers! My
Lord Bacon was almost as profuse of his incense on
the memory of dead Kings, as he was infamous for
clouding the living with it. In the reign of Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
the Seventh, the whole strain of his panegyric (and
it is more justly to be called so than Pliny’s, whose
patron was really a good Prince), is to erect that
sordid Monarch’s tyranny into prudence, nay, his
very knavery into policy! Comines, a honester
writer, though I fear by the masters whom he
pleased, not a much less servile Courtier, says, that
the virtues of Louis the Eleventh preponderated
over his vices! Even Voltaire, who feels for Liberty
more than almost ever any Frenchman did, has in
a manner purified the dross of adulation, which
cotemporary authors had squandered on Louis the
Fourteenth, by adopting and refining it after the
tyrant was dead. In his war of 1741, he paints
that phantom of Royalty, the present King, extinguishing
at Metz, with as much energy of concern,
as if he was describing the death-bed of a
Titus or an Antonine.</p>

<p>But how unpardonable is a flattering history!&mdash;if
anything can shock one of those mortal divinities
(and they must be shocked before they will be corrected),
it would be to find that the truth will be
related of them at last. Nay, is it not cruel to
them to hallow their bad memories? one is sure
they will never <em>hear</em> truth; shall they not even
have a chance of <em>reading</em> it?</p>

<p>It may be wondered that I, who know and have
drawn the emptiness of present Royalty, should, in
the exordium to a new period, in which surely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
effulgence of Majesty has not been displayed with
any new lustre, detain the reader with reflections
on a pageant which has so little operation on the
reality of the drama. But I must be pardoned:
though I now behold only a withering King, good,
as far as acquiescing to whatever is the emergent
humour of his people, and by no means the object
of jealousy to his subjects, yet I am sensible that,
from the prostitution of patriotism, from the art of
Ministers who have had the address to exalt the
semblance while they depressed the reality of
Royalty, and from the bent of the education of the
young Nobility, which verges to French maxims
and to a military spirit, nay, from the ascendant
which the Nobility itself acquires each day in this
country, from all these reflections, I am sensible,
that prerogative and power have been exceedingly
fortified of late within the circle of the Palace; and
though fluctuating Ministries by turns exercise the
deposit, yet there it is; and whenever a Prince of
design and spirit shall sit in the Regal Chair, he
will find a bank, a hoard of power, which he may
play off most fatally against this constitution. That
evil I dread&mdash;the steps to that authority, that torrent
which I should in vain extend a feeble arm to
stem, those steps I mean to follow and record.</p>

<p>My reflections led me early towards, I cannot
quite say Republicanism, but to most limited Monarchy;
a principle as much ridiculed ever since I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
came into the world, as the profligacy of false
patriots has made patriotism&mdash;and from much the
same cause. Republicans professed to be saints, and
from successful sainthood became usurpers: yet
Republicanism, as it tends to promote Liberty, and
Patriotism as far as it tends to preserve or restore
it, are still godlike principles. A Republican who
should be mad, should be execrable enough to
endeavour to imbrue his country in blood merely
to remove the name of a Monarch, deserves to excite
horror; a quiet Republican, who does not dislike
to see the shadow of Monarchy, like Banquo’s
ghost, fill the empty chair of state, that the ambitious,
the murderer, the tyrant, may not aspire
to it; in short, who approves the name of a King,
when it excludes the essence; a man of such principles,
I hope, may be a good man and an honest;
and if he is that, what matters if he is ridiculous?
A Republican, who sees monarchy realizing, who
observes all orders of men tending to exalt higher,
what all orders had concurred to depress; who has
found that the attempts of the greatest men to
divert the torrent, have been turned afterwards to
swell it; who knows the inefficacy of all endeavours
to thwart the bent of a nation, and who is but too
sensible how unequal his own capacity and virtue
would be to so heroic a character; such a man may
be pardoned, I hope, if he contents himself with the
silent suffrage and wishes of his heart, though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
has not the parade of martyrs, nor the courage of a
Roman, in as <em>un-Roman</em>&mdash;(why should it be beneath
the dignity of history to say?) in as <em>un-British</em>
an age as ever was.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Pelham’s death was unexpected; he was
healthy, and not old: all men had concurred to
serve under him; none had prepared any intrigues
to succeed him. The King had found it comfortable
to be governed absolutely, as long as the <em>viceroy<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
over him</em> could govern the kingdom as absolutely:
being told of his Minister’s death, he said
with a sigh, that could not excite much compassion,
“I shall now have no more peace!”</p>

<p>The Houses, who certainly were not to be consulted
on the successor, adjourned themselves for a
week&mdash;who <em>should</em> be consulted, was the question&mdash;for
nobody pretended to suppose that the Sovereign
was to choose his delegate himself. What was as
ridiculous as this state of doubt, was the measure
taken for solving it&mdash;the Duke of Devonshire was
sent for&mdash;a proper dictator, had the only business
of the State been to drive a nail into a wall! The
event put the finishing stroke to the ridicule. In
the meantime, the Lord Chief Justice Lee was appointed
Chancellor of the Exchequer, the forms
depending on that office not admitting an interregnum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
Lord Chief Justice Pratt had been supplied
in like manner on the demission of Aislabie.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>As the temper of the age did not admit the
ancient folly of that presumptuous officer called a
King’s favourite; and as Ministers in late times
had towered to power from ascendants gained by
abilities or address in the House of Commons, it
was natural for the nation to turn its eyes thither:
three subjects there presented themselves before
the rest, as candidates for the first Ministership;
but each attended with almost insuperable difficulties:
these were Fox, Pitt, and Murray. The
Chancellor hated the first: the Scotch and the Law,
two formidable bodies, whom Fox had wantonly
and repeatedly provoked, readily listed under that
banner: the Princess could not love him from his
connexion with the Duke; and though he had been
the ostensible second to Mr. Pelham, he had never
lived upon any terms with the Duke of Newcastle:
but he was the ablest man in Parliament, at least
the craftiest Parliament-man, had acted steadily
with the Whigs, and had in their eyes the seeming
right of succession. Pitt had, or had unluckily
acted, very ill health; and was now at Bath. Mr.
Pelham, who had adopted him, had, however, died
without removing, probably without trying to
remove, his Majesty’s excommunication; and that
was now allowed all its force, as Pitt had no party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
that wished his elevation. Murray was a Scot,
and too lately been the object of clamour on the
worst species of Scotch principles. The Chancellor
was already jealous of him; and both Fox and Pitt
would have concurred for his exclusion. He was
timid himself, and always waving what he was
always courting. This Gordian Knot was soon cut;
and the world that had pretended to look out for a
genius worthy to govern them, in six days descended
from their ambition, and submitted to be ruled by
no abilities at all.</p>

<p>Fox acted reserve and retirement, and expected
to be wooed. His enemies indulged this humour,
and deceived him. Stone went to him, and
in Murray’s name disclaimed all emulation of that
kind, that he never meant to quit his profession,
that he aspired <em>only</em> to be Chancellor. The
Chancellor on his part contributed: he sent Lord
Anson to Fox, to offer reconciliation, though justifying
himself on the former quarrel. Between
the King and Fox several messages passed by the
intervention of Lady Yarmouth. The Princess,
however, expressed her dislike; and the Duke of
Argyle was warm against his promotion. The late
beloved Minister was in the meantime totally forgot,
or only remembered by daily discoveries of the
duplicity of his conduct. Even his brother, who
whimpered for him like a child during the first
hours, like a child forgot him, as soon as he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
formed the plan of inheriting his power: and
nothing tended so much to unravel the mystery of
devotion which the nation had conceived for Mr.
Pelham, as its appearing, that it had not been the
genius of the man, but the servility of the times,
which had established his authority&mdash;in a fortnight
the whole country was prostrate before his brother.</p>

<p>The Duke of Newcastle, who for thirty years
together had sapped every Administration, could
not resist having courage enough to seize it for
himself now it lay so exposed. A faint offer was
made to the Duke of Devonshire to sit at the head
of the Treasury, which he declining, on the 12th of
March at night, only six days after the death of
Mr. Pelham, to the astonishment of all men, yet
only to their astonishment, it was settled that the
Duke of Newcastle should take the Treasury, with
Legge for Chancellor of Exchequer, and that Mr.
Fox should be Secretary of State, with the management
of the House of Commons. Those solemn
personages, the Cabinet Council, were directed to
offer this disposition to his Majesty, as the result of
their wisdoms and opinion&mdash;an opinion, that in two
days more they were reduced to disavow. The King
confirmed this establishment, with this salvo to his
Royalty, that Legge should never enter his closet;
to so scanty a space was his kingdom shrunk! That
very night Lord Hartington was sent to notify the
new regulation to Mr. Fox, with this supplement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
not imparted to the Council, that his Grace would
reserve to himself the disposal of the Secret-Service
Money, though he would always exactly communicate
to Mr. Fox how it had been employed.</p>

<p>The next morning, the Marquis carried Mr. Fox
to the Chancellor, where a reconciliation was completed;
though, as this sincere man told Lyttelton
and Granville, he had made peace with Fox, yet
would never act in concert with him. From thence
they went to the new Vizier. On opening upon
terms and measures, Mr. Fox mentioned the Secret-Service
Money&mdash;the Duke cut him short with saying,
that his brother had never disclosed the disposal
of that money, nor would he. Mr. Fox represented,
that if he was kept in ignorance of that, he
should not know how to talk to members of Parliament,
when some might have received <em>gratifications</em>,
others not. The Duke answered ministerially,
that though he would not inform Mr. Fox,
he would inform no one else. Lord Hartington
ventured to urge that this was not the message on
which he had been sent; and Mr. Fox pushing for
further explanation, asked who was to have the
nomination to places? Newcastle replied, “I myself.”
Fox, “Who the recommendation?” N.
“Any member of the House of Commons.” Fox
then inquired into the projected measures for
securing the approaching Parliament, and what list
Mr. Pelham had left for composing it. The Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
said, “My brother had settled it all with Lord
Duplin.” Fox replied, “Not all;” and named
some unsettled boroughs. The Duke said hastily,
“No, no, all was settled.” Fox said, “I will come
and look over the list with your Grace.” He answered,
“No, I will look it over with Duplin, and
then show it to you.” They came away.</p>

<p>Before I prosecute this barter for power, let me
make one reflection. How avowed was become the
traffic for Parliaments! how extensive the breach
of the constitution, since Pym and Hampden presented
their bosoms to cover and close the gap!
Yet what has befallen this country, but what is
common to sublunary establishments? How few
years had rolled away between the age of Cato’s
Brutus’s, Cicero’s, and the domination of that Imperial
fiddler, Nero? Within how small a period
did the stock-jobber, Julianus, purchase the very
Empire which Trajan had extended to its utmost
limits? The auction of votes is become an established
commerce, and his Grace did nothing but
squabble for the prerogative of being sole appraiser.</p>

<p>Fox felt he was bubbled&mdash;yet was irresolute.
He seemed unaccountably to have lost the spirit
which the Duke seemed as unaccountably to have
acquired. But in this transaction, and in many
subsequent instances, it appeared, that his timidity
was consistent with extreme rashness: his brother’s
timorousness more unallayed, had predominated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
and given the colour of fear to their joint Administration.
The Duke left to himself, always plunged
into difficulties, before he shuddered for the consequences:
the other had possessed more foresight.</p>

<p>Lord Hartington acquainted the Chancellor with
what had passed. He seemed struck; but, as if
conscious to the violation of the terms, or determined
at once to profit of it, said, he could not see the
Duke that evening, but would next morning. At
night, the Duke sent for Lord Hartington; not repentant;
he was not apt to repent of advantageous
treachery. He would not deny the breach of his
engagements, but honestly declared he would not
stand to them. Lord Hartington, as if avowal of
treachery repaired it, expressed no resentment.
His impartiality was ludicrous; he thought he displayed
sufficient friendship to Fox, by publishing
the Duke of Newcastle’s breach of faith; and he
knew he should not offend the latter, by adhering to
a simple relation of his perfidy.</p>

<p>Fox in the meantime consulted his friends.
The Duke of Cumberland dissuaded his complying
with terms infringed ere ratified. Horace Walpole,
the younger, laid before him the succession of the
Duke of Newcastle’s wiles and falsehoods; and being
persuaded that this coalition was intended only to
prejudice Mr. Fox, and that he would be betrayed,
mortified, disgraced, as soon as the new Minister
should have detached him from his connexions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
prevented his strengthening them, urged him to
refuse the Seals. Sir Charles Williams, who happened
to be in England, and whose interest as a
Minister in Foreign Courts, indubitably pointed to
make him wish Mr. Fox Secretary of State, yet
with great honesty laboured in the most earnest
manner to tear him back from the precipice on
which he stood. He yielded, yet never<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> forgave
Sir Charles Williams, whose dissuasion having been
most vehement, had made most impression on him.
He sent the following letter by Lord Hartington to
the Duke of Newcastle:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right fs80">March 14th, 1754.</p>

<p class="pad1">My Lord Duke,</p>

<p>As your Grace intends to wait upon his Majesty
to-day, I must lose no time to desire your Grace
would not acquaint his Majesty that I have accepted
the office of Secretary of State. But, if his Majesty
has already been acquainted with my acceptance of
it, your Grace will, I hope, tell his Majesty that I
purpose, with the utmost submission, to beg his
Majesty’s leave to decline it. It is impossible his
Majesty could think of raising me to so exalted a
station, but with a design that I should, with and
under your Grace, have the management of his
affairs in the House of Commons. This was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
whole tenour of your Grace’s messages by Lord Hartington,
which, in your Grace’s conference with
Lord Hartington and me yesterday morning, and
with Lord Hartington last night, have been totally
contradicted. Unable, therefore, to answer what,
I dare say, is his Majesty’s expectation (though
your Grace has frankly declared it not to be yours),
that I should be answerable for his Majesty’s affairs
in the House of Commons, I beg leave to remain
where I am, heartily wishing success to his Majesty’s
affairs, and contributing all that shall be in the
power of a single man towards it. I am, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>On 16th, Fox saw the King. The former said,
with humility, that in seven years he had never
presumed to enter first on other affairs than of his
province. The King interrupted him, “It was a
great place I designed for you; I thought I did
much for you; many Dukes have had it.” Fox
answered, “Sir, your Majesty has been told that I
asked for too much.” The King said, “You did;
the Secret Service money has never been in other
hands than the person’s at the head of the Treasury.”
“Perhaps, Sir,” replied Fox, “I did ask too
much; but they were more in fault who promised
and broke their word: Lord Hartington is witness.
I shall speak with truth, not with modesty. I
might be a great man in the House of Commons, if
I would be Secretary of State at the head of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
Opposition&mdash;but I prefer serving your Majesty as a
private man, without seeing the Duke of Newcastle.
He promised me his confidence: I never can believe
him more. I am honest, he is not.” The King
concluded, “I know it cannot be made up; you are
not apt to depart from your resolution&mdash;it is a
great office! but I have learned <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemini obtrudere
beneficium</i>.”</p>

<p>The triumphant Duke having disabled Fox, and
being possessed of Murray, or rather the agent of
power for him, had little trouble with the remaining
competitor. Sir George Lyttelton, whose warmest
prayer was to go to heaven in a Coronet, undertook
to be factor for his friends. Unauthorized, he
answered for Pitt’s acquiescence under the new plan.
He obtained a great employment for himself, overlooked
Lord Temple, and if he stipulated without
commission for George Grenville, at least it was for
a preferment, large beyond the latter’s most possible
presumption.</p>

<p>All impediments thus removed, Newcastle obtained
his full list of preferments; and the rest of the month
was employed in forming and establishing his new
court. Legge, as has been said, was made Chancellor
of the Exchequer&mdash;unwillingly: he preferred
his own more profitable place, less obnoxious to
danger and envy. The meanness of his appearance,
and the quaintness of his dialect, made him as improper
for it as unwilling. Sandys’s solemn dulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
had made men regret Sir Robert Walpole’s cheerful
dignity: Legge’s arch gravity struck no impression
after Mr. Pelham’s peevish authority: men had no
notion of an epigrammatic Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Lord Barnard, Lord Duplin, and Nugent
composed the rest of the Treasury. George Grenville
succeeded Legge as Treasurer of the Navy.
Sir George Lyttelton was made Cofferer; Lord
Hilsborough Comptroller of the Household, and
Lord Barrington Master of the Great Wardrobe, in
the room of Sir Thomas Robinson, who, to give
some relief to Lord Holderness, and no possibility
of umbrage to the fretful Duke, was nominated to
the Seals, which Mr. Fox had declined.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas had been bred in German Courts, and
was rather restored than naturalized to the genius
of that country: he had German honour, loved
German politics, and could explain himself as little
as if he spoke only German. He might have remained
in obscurity, if the Duke of Newcastle’s
necessity of employing men of talents inferior even
to his own, and his alacrity in discovering persons
so qualified, had not dragged poor Sir Thomas into
light and ridicule; yet, if the Duke had <em>intended</em>
to please his master, he could not have succeeded
more happily than by presenting him with so congenial
a servant: the King, with such a Secretary
in his closet, felt himself in the very Elysium of
Herenhausen!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chancellor’s sincerity and services were
crowned with an Earldom; but, as Roman Consuls
in the very car of Victory were coupled with a
slave, to remind them of their mortality, Harry
Vane (lately become Lord Barnard by the death of
his father,) was created Earl of Darlington at the
same hour.</p>

<p>While England was re-settling into a calm, the
troubles continued in Ireland. A dangerous tumult
was raised at the theatre; the audience called for a
repetition of these lines in a translation of Voltaire’s
Mahomet:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse10">&mdash;&mdash; if, ye powers divine,</p>
<p class="verse">Ye mark the movements of this nether world,</p>
<p class="verse">And bring them to account; crush, crush these vipers,</p>
<p class="verse">Who, singled out by a community</p>
<p class="verse">To guard their rights, shall, for a grasp of ore,</p>
<p class="verse">Or paltry office, sell them to the foe.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Diggs, the actor, refused, by order of Sheridan,
the manager, to repeat them: Sheridan would not
even appear on the stage to justify the prohibition.
In an instant, the audience demolished the inside of
the house, and reduced it to a shell. The Lord
Mayor was sent for; he said he was sick: the
High-Constable; he was said to be out of town. At
the same time, the King issued the contested money
by his own authority; for, as the whole currency of
Ireland does not amount to above 500,000<em>l.</em>, the
specie in question was necessary to carry on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
circulation. The Castle wore so little a spirit of
pacification, that the Duke of Dorset wrote to press
the disgrace of the Speaker: but the English Ministry
would have conjured down the storm by
pressing the Earl of Hertford to go Lord Deputy,
when the Duke of Dorset should return, which
would have avoided the ungracious renewal of the
Primate’s share in the Regency. But this was a
most unwelcome measure, not to that Prelate only;
Lord George Sackville foresaw that Mr. Conway, a
kind of contemporary rival, and brother of Lord
Hertford, would necessarily share the popular merit
of restoring tranquillity; and accordingly, as was
supposed, instigated the Irish Chancellor to write to
England, that, if he was to carry the Seals before
Lord Hertford, he should desire to come to England
during that period. Not content with this, the
Duke himself wrote to prevent having Lord Hertford
for Deputy. The Duke of Newcastle and the
Chancellor were much inclined to the pacific method,
but the faction of Stone and Murray prevailed, of
whom the latter always counselled authoritative
measures. It was the Duke of Newcastle’s turn to
be bullied. As the latter had usurped England,
and the Duke of Argyle had wormed himself into
the sole power in Scotland, Dorset asserted and
maintained his ascendant in Ireland. The Speaker
was removed, and Mr. Hill, uncle of Lord Hilsborough,
was made Chancellor of the Exchequer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
his room. The Primate, the Chancellor, and Lord
Besborough, were constituted Lords Justices on the
Duke’s return to England.</p>

<p>On the 8th of April, the Chief-Justice Lee died:
Sir Dudley Rider succeeded him; Murray rose to
Attorney-General, and Sir Richard Loyd was made
Solicitor. The same day the English Parliament
was dissolved; and on the 31st of the following
month, the new Parliament, chosen in the very
spirit of the Pelhams, met and sat for five or six
days in order to pass one Bill, and constitute their
essence; for, by the Regency Bill, the last Parliament
that should sit in the life of the King, was to
revive on his death; and the new one was too acceptable
to the Ministry, not to be insured. Mr.
Legge presided at the Cockpit meeting, for reading
the King’s Speech to the Court members. The
little man lost his temperance of spirit, and began
to deceive himself into an opinion of being a
Minister: the Duke of Newcastle, as severe a
monitor to Ministers of their nothingness as the
most moral preacher, and more efficacious, soon
shuffled him out of his dream of grandeur, and
having raised him as high as was necessary to his
own views, took an immediate turn of depressing
and using him ill. At the Treasury Board, the
Duke gave papers cross him to Lord Duplin to
read, and even sent the latter into the city to
negotiate the money affairs for the Government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
The obsequiousness of his creatures could not exempt
them from his Grace’s jealousy, as oft as he
approached them too near to his own person.
Legge gave an artful turn to his disgust, and
vaunted to the Whigs that his want of favour was
owing to his refusal of acting in concert with Stone
and Murray: “But that would have been a stain,”
said he, “which I thought no time could wash
away.”</p>

<p>Pitt came to town much in discontent: Newcastle
asked him his opinion of the new settlement:
he declined answering; on being pressed, he replied,
“Your Grace will be surprised, but I think
Mr. Fox should have been at the head of the House
of Commons.” Their mutual discontents soon led
Pitt and Fox to an explanation on their situation,
and on all who had endeavoured to inspire them
with jealousy. Pitt complained most of Mr.
Pelham, who, he said, had always deprecated, but
always fomented their variance. The Chancellor,
ever since Pitt’s return, had falsely boasted to
him of having proposed him for Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The halcyon days of the new Administration
soon began to be overcast by foreign clouds. The
pacific genius of the house of Pelham was not unknown
to France, and fell in very conveniently
with their plan of extensive empire. They had
yielded to a peace with us, only to recover breath,
and to recoil with greater force after a few years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
of recruited strength; yet even in the short term
lapsed since the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, they
had not been unactive. Complaisance in Europe
was to cover encroachments in both Indies. Mr.
Pelham was willing to be the dupe. If the nation
demanded no redress, he would neither propose nor
seek it. Redress could be procured but by arms;
armaments must be furnished by money; money
to be raised might create murmurs; opposition
might ensue&mdash;were national honour or interest
worth hazarding that? And having had the merit
of lessening the National Debt, he had the more
justifiable and reasonable excuse of dreading to
augment it again, when it was still so burthensome.
In the East Indies we had lost Madras in
the late war; and since the peace, under pretence
of the two nations engaging on different sides in
support of two contending Nabobs, hostilities had
continued with various success.</p>

<p>During Mr. Pelham’s rapid decline of health, a
small fleet had been fitted out to protect a trade,
which the numerous reinforcements dispatched by
the French East India Company, with equal countenance
from their Crown, had already rendered
very precarious, indeed desperate. In Africa, they
debauched our Allies, erected forts, and aimed at
embracing the whole Gold Coast and Guinea trade.
But their attempts in America grew daily more
open, more avowed, more alarming, indeed extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
to nothing less than by erecting a chain of
garrisons from Canada to the mouths of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the Mississipi'">the Mississippi</ins>,
to back all our settlements, cut off our communication
with the Indians west of that river,
and inclose and starve our universal plantations
and trade: it would not be necessary to invade
them, they would fall of course. The discussions
left unsettled by the precipitate peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
and proposed to be adjusted by those
most ineffective of all negotiators, Commissaries,
gave, not a pretence, rather an invitation to the
French, to dispatch by force of arms the liquidation
of an affair which might be explained to their
disadvantage. The fatal treaty of Utrecht had
left but too many of our interests in the West
Indies problematic: the impetuosity of Lord Bolingbroke
to betray Europe left him no moments, could
inspire him with no zeal to assert our pretensions
in America. The rights of either nation, as adjudged
by treaties and mutual concessions, and
more easily still to be defined by their actual
establishments, were capable of being made tolerably
clear: if explored to their source, they were
mere pretensions in both. The topic, striking as
it is to a mind that can philosophise, abstractedly
from connexions with any particular country, is
too common to be enlarged upon.</p>

<p>A sea captain first spying a rock in the fifteenth
century; perhaps a cross, or a coat of arms set up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
to the view of a few miles of coast by an adventurer,
or even by a shipwrecked crew, gave the
first claims to Kings and archpirates over an unknown
tract of country. This transitory seizure
sometimes obtained the venerable confirmation of
an old priest at Rome (who, a century or two
before, had in his infallibility pronounced that the
existence of such a country was impossible), or of
a still more politic, though not less interested
Privy Council at home. Sometimes, indeed, if
the discoverers were conscientious, they made a
legal purchase to all eternity, of empires and posterity
from a parcel of naked natives, for a handful
of glass beads and baubles. Maryland, I think,
was solemnly acquired at the extravagant rate of a
quantity of vermilion and Jew’s-harps: I don’t
know whether the authentic instrument may not
be recorded in that Christian depository the Court
of Chancery. By means so holy, a few Princes,
who would be puzzled to produce a legitimate title
to their own dominions in Europe, were wafted
into rights and prerogatives over the boundless
regions of America. Detachments were sent to
take possession of the new discoveries; they
peopled the seaports, they sprinkled themselves over
the coasts, they enslaved or assisted the wretched
natives to butcher one another, instructed them
in the use of firearms, of brandy, and the New
Testament, and at last, by scattered extension of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
forts and colonies, they have met to quarrel for
the boundaries of Empires, of which they can
neither use nor occupy a twentieth part of the
included territory.</p>

<p>What facilitated the enterprises of the French
was the extreme ignorance in which the English
Court had kept themselves of the affairs of America.
That department is subjected to the Secretary of
State for the Southern Province, assisted by the
Board of Trade. That Board, during Sir Robert
Walpole’s administration, had very faultily been
suffered to lapse almost into a sinecure; and during
all that period the Duke of Newcastle had been
Secretary of State. It would not be credited what
reams of papers, representations, memorials, petitions,
from that quarter of the world lay mouldering
and unopened in his office. West Indian
Governors could not come within the sphere of his
jealousy: nothing else merited or could fix his
mercurial inattention. He knew as little of the
geography of his province as of the state of it:
when General Legonier hinted some defence to him
for Annapolis, he replied with his evasive lisping
hurry, “Annapolis, Annapolis! oh! yes, Annapolis
must be defended; to be sure, Annapolis should be
defended&mdash;where is Annapolis?” When the French
invasions forced him to arouse a little from this
lethargy, he struggled to preserve his inactivity,
by ordering letters of the most abject and submissive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
import to be written to our Governors, who
pressed for instructions, nay, for permission to defend
themselves. Somewhat more of this will
appear hereafter. But if he sacrificed the dignity
of the Crown with one hand, he thought to exalt it
with the other: the prerogative was strained unwarrantably
over the Assemblies: the instructions
to Sir Danvers Osborn, a new Governor of New
York, seemed better calculated for the latitude of
Mexico and for a Spanish tribunal, than for a free
rich British Settlement, and in such opulence and
of such haughtiness, that suspicions had long<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> been
conceived of their meditating to throw off their
dependence on their mother country.</p>

<p>Lord Halifax, who now presided at the Board of
Trade, and who, among the concessions of the Pelhams,
had wrenched much American authority from
the Secretary of State, was fond of power and
business, was jealous of his own and country’s
honour, encouraged and countenanced plans and
lights for preserving and extending our trade and
dominion in that hemisphere, and as much as he
could counteracted the supineness of the Administration.
Had the Rulers of the State been as
alert, the season was favourable; and uncommon
incidents threw occasions into their hands of dispelling
the dangers that hung over them from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
French. Spain was revolved to its true interest;
the rudder of Bourbon no longer steered their
Court. The ambitious Queen Dowager, who by money,
intrigues, and by the prospect of her
son Carlos’s succession, as the King was likely to
have no children, had preserved a potent faction
in the Ministry, was sinking into impotence of
power, and saw all her schemes blasted. Don
Caravalho and Lancaster, the Prime Minister,
died in April this year: the Duke d’Huescar succeeded,
and had raised his friend General Wall to
be Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is not to be
told with what regret the latter quitted England,
which had become his country as much by affection
as by extraction. He and the Duke were
fortunately old Spaniards in principle, and being
obnoxious to, were consequently averse to, the
Queen Dowager and her French party. One of
the first effects of this new Ministry was the fall of
Ensenada, the creature of the Queen Dowager. Sir
Benjamin Keene discovered, and imparted by the
means of General Wall to the King, that Ensenada
had sent orders to their West Indian Governors to
fall on our ships, and had lent great sums of the
Royal treasure to the French East India Company.
He was disgraced, but with great lenity, and exiled
to Granada.</p>

<p>While the Duke of Newcastle neglected such
real opportunities of popularity, he was entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
into little details in the Treasury, and threatened
great reformations in trifles. The first abuses to
be moderated or rooted out were pensions and
quarterings on places; the former to gratify his
Majesty, the latter to please public opinion. This
lasted a fortnight: to support his vain power, both
abuses were in his very second year, as will be seen,
pushed to enormity.</p>

<p>In August came news of the defeat of Major
Washington in the Great Meadows on the western
borders of Virginia: a trifling action, but remarkable<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
for giving date to the war. The encroachments
of the French have been already mentioned;
but in May they had proceeded to open hostilities.
Major Washington with about fifty men attacked
one of their parties, and slew the commanding
Officer. In this skirmish he was supported by an
Indian half king and <em>twelve</em> of his subjects, who
in the Virginian accounts, is called a very considerable
Monarch. On the third of July, the French
being reinforced to the number of nine hundred,
fell on Washington in a small fort, which they
took, but dismissed the Commander with military
honours, being willing, as they expressed it in the
capitulation, to show that they treated them like
friends! In the express which Major Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
dispatched on his preceding little victory, he concluded
with these words; “I heard the bullets
whistle, and believe me, there is something charming
in the sound.” On hearing of this letter, the King
said sensibly, “He would not say so, if he had
been used to hear many.” However, this brave
braggart<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> learned to blush for his rodomontade,
and desiring to serve General Braddock <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'as Aid-de-camp'">as Aide-de-camp</ins>,
acquitted himself nobly.</p>

<p>The violence of this proceeding gave a reverberation
to the stagnated politics of the Ministry: in
a moment, the Duke of Newcastle assumed the hero,
and breathed nothing but military operations: he
and the Chancellor held Councils of War; none of
the Ministers, except Lord Holderness, were admitted
within their tent. They knew too well how
proper the Duke was to be consulted: of course
they were jealous, and did not consult him. Instead
of him, they summoned one Gates,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> a very
young officer just returned from Nova Scotia, and
asked his advice. He was too sensible of their
absurdity, and replied, that he had never served
but in Nova Scotia, and it would be impertinent to
give his opinion; he was ready to answer any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>questions. They knew not what to ask. When
this lad would not be a Marshal, they next consulted
one Hanbury, a Quaker, and at his recommendation
determined upon Sharpe, the Governor
of Virginia, for their General. They told the King
he had served all the last war, though he had never
served, and that the Duke had a good opinion of
him: the Duke said, “So good, that if Sharpe had
been consulted, I am sure he would have refused.”
We must defer the history of the campaign till its
proper season.</p>

<p>No other event happened before the meeting of
the Parliament except the decision of a famous
cause. The inhabitants of Richmond and the
neighbouring gentlemen, even instigated underhand
by the Duke of Newcastle, had commenced
a suit against Princess Amelie<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> for the right and
liberty of entering into New Park at their pleasure:
the case was this: Charles the First made the
park, partly by pecuniary, partly by compulsory
methods, and gave great disgusts by it. Queen
Anne gave two or more lives in it to her relations,
the Hydes, who suffered it to run to great decay.
When Sir Robert Walpole became Minister, who
was fond of hunting, and wanted occasional retirement
and exercise, he persuaded King George the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
First to buy out the family of Hyde, and obtained
the Rangership for his eldest son, which was confirmed
to him by the present King for life. It was
a bog, and a harbour for deer-stealers and vagabonds.
Sir Robert Walpole drained it, and expended
great sums upon it himself; but to obtain
more privacy and security, he took away the
ladders on the walls, and shut up the gates, but
settled keepers at them, who were to open to all foot-passengers
in the daytime, and to such carriages as
had tickets, which were easily obtained. Princess
Amelie succeeded his son Lord Orford, but preserved
no measures of popularity. Her brother
William had incredibly disgusted the neighbourhood
of Windsor by excluding them from most of
the benefits of the park there. The Princess entirely
shut up New Park, except by giving very
few tickets. Petitions were presented to her; she
would not receive them. They were printed in the
public Newspapers, but had as little effect. Subscriptions
were formed, conferences were held to no
purpose. At last the cause was brought to a trial.
Sir John Philipps and the younger Beckford presented
themselves as tribunes of the people to
plead the cause, but instead of influencing the
Court, they confounded the rest of their Council.
The Princess carried her cause.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>
<p>The children of the Crown in England have no
landed appanages: they naturally covet them:
Rangerships for lives are the only territories the
King has to bestow. Both the Duke and his sister
entered more easily into the spirit of prerogative
than was decent in a family brought hither for the
security of liberty. To shut up Windsor or Richmond
parks, if the law permits, is no violation of
the constitution; but when Princes of the Blood
(and the race is likely to be numerous) come to
stand suits for exclusive privileges, it is easy to
foresee into what excesses their ambition or their
necessities may make them slide.</p>

<p>Nov. 14th.&mdash;The Parliament met. The King’s
speech endeavoured to inculcate notions of tranquillity,
yet with preserving a salvo for demanding
supplies hereafter, by just hinting at the preservation
of our rights in America. Sir George Lee,
who moved the Address in the Commons, spoke
plainly on Spain’s having given orders for restoring
our ships. Mr. Conway, who seconded him, went
a little farther, and descanted on the increase of
France. Potter ridiculed Ministerial Addresses
well; called them the late lullabies that always acquainted
us with the disposition of all the European
powers to preserve the peace&mdash;but France indeed
had spoiled that part of the speech for this year:
yet he would agree to the Address, and consider
measures hereafter. The Ministers did not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
which should act Minister for the day: at last
Murray pushed up Legge, who said a few words
without dignity; the tenour and point of which was
that our conduct was to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fortiter in re, suaviter
in modo</i>. Beckford said, that we had had such an
order for restitution from Spain two years ago; and
therefore he should not trust to this. That the
marine and colonies of France had not increased in
proportion to ours. That we should exert naval
strength instead of alliances. With those great
alliances in the last war we had run thirty millions
in debt. Queen Elizabeth, in her distress, did not
go about begging and buying alliances.</p>

<p>Mr. Conway replied in a few words elegantly,
that Beckford had mistaken him; that he had not
said that the colonies of France had increased in
proportion to ours, but along with their landed
power in Europe; however, that he was far from
not thinking them very formidable in America;
for, if we considered their extent of country along
the rivers and lakes, it was like a net, which, if
drawn a little tighter, might shuffle us into the sea.
Lord Egmont, who always larded, or composed his
speeches with speculative topics of government, went
back to the Revolution, which, he said, was Rebellion,
if anything more than restitution of the old
constitution. That he would not oppose the Address,
because we wanted unanimity, but that too
languid a spirit prevailed. That it was thought so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
necessary to keep peace in the Administration, that
we dared not take great steps: yet now was the
time, when the House was no longer under any
ministerial influence: however, we must take care
not to provoke France, when part of the King’s
dominions (Ireland) was so discontented. Murray
observed, that the new members must wonder at a
Debate without a question or opposition: but, said
he, how will all this be represented abroad? to
Spain, that we don’t believe their offers: to Germany,
that we would shake off all our Allies: to
France, that we reckon the peace broken; and that
we make no distinction between our rights and our
possessions. For the Colonies, he believed they
would sacrifice everything rather than submit to
France: yet was it judicious in Lord Egmont to
throw out notions of discontents? The Address
passed without a negative.</p>

<p>About this time came unwelcome news to the
King: his son-in-law, Frederic, Hereditary Prince
of Hesse Cassel, was discovered to be turned Papist.
He was a brutal German, obstinate, of no genius,
and after long treating Princess Mary, who was the
mildest and gentlest of her race, with great inhumanity,
had for some time lived upon no terms with
her: his father, the Landgrave William, protected
her: an arbitrary, artful man, of no reputation for
integrity. The hereditary Prince was devoted to
France and Prussia. It was not an age when conversions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
were common; nor were his morals strict
enough to countenance any pretence to scruples; it
was necessary to recur to private or political reasons
for his change, and, from what has been said, it
appears in what numbers they presented themselves.
Yet even the King of Prussia acted zeal
for the Protestant cause. The Landgrave was as
outrageous as if he felt for it too. No obstructions
being offered by the Catholic powers, the Landgrave
and States, with the concurrence of the King,
enacted heavy restrictions on the Prince, whenever
he should succeed his father.</p>

<p>The scene began to darken at home. As the
Duke of Newcastle had secured by employments
almost every material speaker in Parliament, it was
hoped that the session would be amused, and pass
off with regulating controverted elections: there
was one of much expectation. The majority in all
late Parliaments, and still more in this devoted one,
had been composed solely from boroughs: counties
were too extensive to be ventured upon in the way
of expense, and had been left to their own ill humours,
and to the country gentlemen: Oxfordshire
in particular had long been a little kingdom of
Jacobitism. The Duke of Marlborough, prodigal,
and never judicious in his extravagance, would not
content himself with the offer made to him by the
county, of electing his son as soon as he should be
of age: he determined to choose both representatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
from his own party. Mr. Pelham had received
the proposal with joy: that Duke was led by Fox:
if the contest succeeded, Mr. Pelham would command
two more members; if it miscarried, Fox and
the Duke of Marlborough would labour under all
the unpopularity. After unbounded expense, the
four candidates were all returned, and the House
was to decide on the merits, which must take up
several weeks.</p>

<p>There was another election depending, of still
nicer discussion; that of Mitchell, in Cornwall.
Lord Sandwich had long dictated there, upon the
interest of his nephew, Courtney, a minor. The
Duke of Newcastle had now encouraged the Boscawens
and Edgcumbes to oppose him. Lord
Sandwich secured the returning officer, but a petition
was lodged against his members. Fox, who
sought all opportunities, where the King’s name
could not be pretended, of crossing the Duke of
Newcastle, warmly and openly espoused Lord
Sandwich. Pitt, as ill disposed, was neuter in
this; but in the Reading election pretended connexions
with Lord Fane, Lord Sandwich’s brother-in-law,
and declared on the same side. In this
temper the Parliament had opened; and Pitt, who,
though ready to give words in change, was not a
man to take them, had already come to some
explanation with the Duke of Newcastle, and had
even said to him, “Fewer words, my Lord, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
please, for your words have long lost all weight
with me.”</p>

<p>21st.&mdash;A day was to be appointed for hearing
the Mitchell election: Lord Sandwich, who tried
to defer its being heard, was beat with 127 by 154.</p>

<p>25th.&mdash;Another petition being in agitation, the
House thin and idle, a younger Delaval had spoken
pompously and abusively against the petitioner,
and had thrown the House into a laughter on the
topics of bribery and corruption. Pitt, who was
in the gallery, started, and came down with impetuosity,
and with all his former fire said, “He
had asked what occasioned such an uproar; lamented
to hear a laugh on such a subject as
bribery! Did we try <em>within</em> the House to diminish
our own dignity, when such attacks were made
upon it from without? that it was almost lost!
that it wanted support! that it had long been
vanishing! scarce possible to recover it! that he
hoped the Speaker would extend a saving hand to
raise it: he could only restore it&mdash;yet scarce he!
He called on all to assist, or else <em>we should only
sit to register the arbitrary edicts of One too
powerful a subject</em>!” This thunderbolt, thrown
in a sky so long serene, confounded the audience.
Murray crouched, silent and terrified. Legge
scarce rose to say with great humility, “That he
had been raised solely by the Whigs, and if he fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
sooner or later, he should pride himself in nothing
but in being a Whig.”</p>

<p>The evening of this novel day was still more
tempestuous. The Committee of Elections opened.
Mr. Gray, a steady but plausible Tory, favoured by
the Chancellor and Sir George Lyttelton, desired
to have the petition against him from Colchester
deferred, till it was sure of being heard. Sir
Thomas Robinson said, “That might be soon, for
the Reading election, which was to precede it, could
not last long; there was but a majority of one vote
for Lord Fane, and it was a poor cause.” Pitt
sprung up, and attacked Sir Thomas fiercely; told
him how ignorant he was to talk in that style of a
cause unheard; that he was not to be thus taught
his duty by any man; but if the first officer in the
State could make so gross a supposition, there would
be short work with elections: he never thought to
see so melancholy a day! Sir Thomas replied with
pomp, confusion, and warmth, that spirit should be
shown: could gentlemen, could merchants, could
the House bear, if eloquence alone was to carry it?
he hoped words only would not prevail! that for
himself, he executed an office, of which he had never
been ambitious. Pitt replied with cool art, and
showed that he had only aimed the stroke at the
Duke of Newcastle, through Sir Thomas, to whom
he now spoke with respect, and with esteem of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
integrity; adding, <em>that he thought him as able as
any man that had of late years filled that office,
or was likely to fill it</em>. The weapons that Pitt
laid down Fox took up, and exercised them with
still more inveteracy and warmth on poor Sir
Thomas and his ignorance: “If one of the greatest
men in the House pronounced it a poor cause, it
would indeed be a poor cause; but he imputed it to
his inexperience: he was the first great man, and
he hoped would be the last, that ever pronounced
so on a cause unheard!” It was plain that Pitt
and Fox were impatient of any superior; and as
plain by the complexion and murmurs of the House
in support of Sir Thomas Robinson, that the
inclinations of the members favoured neither of
them.</p>

<p>27th.&mdash;The Committee sat on the Army, late
but without a division; and in general the Debate
was dull: the subject had long been exhausted, and
during the former Opposition had been a constant
day for teaching young and callow orators to
soar. The younger Beckford, who had been announced
for a genius, and had laid a foundation for
being so, by studying magazines and historical
registers, made a tedious harangue against standing
armies; and moved for 15,000 men, instead of the
old number of 18,800. Lord Barrington answered
him well, and told him how little difference it
would make to the constitution; if eighteen thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
intended to overturn it, fifteen might. That
none of the usual number could be spared; from
whence could they? The licentiousness of the
capital, the mutinous miners and colliers, the
smugglers, the destroyers of turnpikes, all the outlaws
that increase of riches and licence produces
and encourages, all were to be kept in awe. And
so far from soldiers being a burthen, the country
rejoices in being under their protection. That instead
of squabbling for trifles, everybody should
unite at this conjuncture to make the late great
man as little missed as possible. That the great
men he has left will show spirit; and spirit never
brought on a war. His Majesty has the hearts of
the people, of all who can feel gratitude or the
benefits of their own situation. The Ministry
have popularity, and it must be owing to Beckford’s
absence in Jamaica, that he did not know
that the period which he had wished to see of a
popular King and Administration, was actually
arrived&mdash;but perhaps Jamaica Newspapers were as
faulty as our own. Fox told the elder Beckford,
that if he was Sheriff next year, he hoped he would
not keep the resolution he had declared, of not calling
in the military, if they are wanted: and added,
that the soldiers behave so discreetly, that in eight
years that he had been Secretary at War, he had
not received three complaints in a year, even
from innkeepers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>Nugent added in reply to Beckford (who had
said that the Opposition were Whigs and the
Ministry Tories,) that he hoped he had not taken
his idea of Whigs from those who refused
King William his Dutch troops: if he had, he
did not wonder that he mistook the Ministers
for Tories. He applied the old apologue of the
hen and ducklings; and then flew out into this
gross and barefaced strain, <em>that there did not
exist an honester man than the Duke of Newcastle!</em>
professing that he should be the most
crouching slave if he meant this for flattery.
Pitt, only smiling at this Drawcansir in adulation,
and bent to pursue the humiliation of Murray,
said that the moderation of the Estimate was a
proof of the Crown’s attention to economy; but he
could by no means agree in our opulence, and would
recommend it to gentlemen not to deceive themselves
or others. We are in reality a distressed
people: he hated declamation, and was as little
given to anger, but nothing should hinder him from
asserting what he felt, and from averring what he
knew. Young members may allow too much to
what is spoken in that place: when anybody says
he don’t believe that Jacobitism exists, he would
tell him to his face he did not believe what he said.
Nugent called him to order.</p>

<p>Pitt was a little disconcerted, but resuming himself
said, “For the nursing mother, the hen, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
been bred under such an one,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and he would tell
the House what she had been doing for these
twenty years; she had been raising a succession of
treason&mdash;there never was such a seminary! but he
would throw himself into the gap, and would as
cheerfully make his protest alone, as in the most
applauding assembly. He knew what he was; he
knew what he would be; and was too cool not to
know what he said. That the body he meant (Oxford)
was learned and respectable: so much the
more dangerous! he would mention what had happened
to himself the last summer on a party of
pleasure thither. They were at the window of the
Angel Inn; a lady was desired to sing <em>God save
great George our King!</em> The chorus was re-echoed
by a set of young lads drinking at a college
over the way, but with additions of rank treason. He
hoped, as they were lads, he should be excused from
not having taken more notice of it. After this,
walking down the High Street, in a Bookseller’s
shop he observed a print of a young Highlander
with a blue ribbon: the Bookseller, thinking he
wanted to buy it, held it out to him&mdash;but what was
the motto!&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hunc saltem everso Juvenem!</i>&mdash;This
was the prayer of that learned body&mdash;for it was
in Latin!” Colours, much less words, could not
paint the confusion and agitation that worked in
Murray’s face during this almost apostrophe! his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
countenance spoke everything that Fawcett had
been terrified to prevaricate away.</p>

<p>Two days after this, an incident happened of a
private nature, scarce worth mentioning, but as it
served to dissolve the remains of so historic a
friendship as that of Mr. Pitt and Sir George
Lyttelton, and brought out <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'all the coolurs'">all the colours</ins> of
some remarkable characters. Mr. Conway was repeating
with concern to the younger Walpole the
lamentations of Sir George on Mr. Pitt’s coldness<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
and his own apprehensions that the complexion
of the times denoted new troubles. Walpole,
who had not so pacific a disposition, but whose
passion to see a new Opposition had been considerably
damped by Mr. Fox’s acquiescence under
the Duke of Newcastle’s sole power, and who
loved Mr. Conway enough to sacrifice to his
love of peace, when he had little prospect of gratifying
his own love of party, owned to him carelessly,
that he knew the Duke of Bedford had
a propensity to reconcile himself to the Court,
that the Duchess and her friends were eager for
it, and gave Mr. Conway leave to talk it over
with Sir George Lyttelton, if by any means they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
could make use of this disposition to reconcile
the growing humours. It was singular, that
Horace Walpole, who had so eagerly attacked the
promotion both of Pitt and Lyttelton, should, in
the most distant manner, negotiate their re-union.
However, on reflection (for it is certain that he
had dropped this discourse without any), he recollected,
that it was not acting handsomely by Mr.
Fox, who at least was out of humour, to throw
new strength into the Duke of Newcastle; and
accordingly went to Mr. Conway to retract the
permission he had given, and to desire no mention
might be made of what had passed in their conversation&mdash;but
how was he surprised to meet Mr.
Conway coming to him in the greatest anxiety, and
begging his pardon, for what indeed Mr. Conway
was not to blame.</p>

<p>In short, Sir George Lyttelton, who had before
professed to Mr. Conway a resolution of quitting
his employment, unless he could hold it with Mr.
Pitt’s good opinion, had been so struck with the
first idea of what he heard of the Duke of
Bedford, and saw such an opening to favour by
transacting the treaty, that instead of consulting
with, or leaving it to Mr. Conway’s coolness or fitness
to chalk out the path of negotiation, he hurried
to Newcastle House, and whispered his intelligence.
Newcastle said, with his usual hurry,
“My dear Sir George, there is nothing I would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
give to accomplish such a reconciliation.” Sir
George, accepting this declaration as full powers,
and forgetting at once that he was aggravating his
breach of friendship with Mr. Pitt, and that of all
men living he was the most improper to transact
with the Duke of Bedford on so nice a point, having
quitted him for Newcastle, and being involved in
a private family quarrel with him too, posted away
to Bedford House, demanded an audience, took no
measures to soften the abruptness of his commission,
but at once told that Duke, that he understood
his Grace was a little mollified, and in the Duke of
Newcastle’s name, offered him <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">charte blanche</i>.&mdash;How
was the volunteer Ambassador astonished at a
flat refusal! The hot little Duke was transported
with the importance this gave him; and notwithstanding
the solicitation of the Duchess and his
Court, whose measures were all overset by Lyttelton’s
awkward policy, the Duke immediately sent
for Mr. Pitt, and communicated the message.
Pitt flattered his steady virtue and disinterestedness,
and broke openly with Sir George, who was
first disavowed by the Duke of Newcastle, and then
disavowed his own having gone so far as he had
done. Horace Walpole, who would have had art
indeed, had he planned and foreseen how the event
would blow up the six months’ labour of the pacific
part of Bedford House, but who had acted merely
from inadvertence, laughed and confirmed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
Duke of Bedford in his highest opinion of his own
importance and steady virtue.</p>

<p>The late impetuous and joint attack on Sir
Thomas Robinson had alarmed his principal: the
Duke of Newcastle saw his mighty power totter;
yet he could not determine to share it. The first
thought was to dismiss Pitt. This was too bold a
measure to have the preference long: the next,
more natural, was to try to sweeten Fox: accordingly,
on the morning of the 29th, the King sent
for Fox, and reproached him for concurring to
worry Sir Thomas Robinson, and asked him if he
had united with Pitt to oppose his measures? Fox
assured him he had not, and that he had given him
his honour he would resign first. “Then,” said
the King, “will you stand up and carry on my
measures in the House of Commons, as you can do,
with spirit?” Fox replied, “I must know, Sir,
what means I shall have, or I cannot answer for
what I cannot answer.” “It will be better for
you,” said the King; “you shall have favour, advantage,
and confidence”&mdash;but would not explain
particulars, only asking, if he would go to the
Duke of Newcastle. “I must, if you command
me,” answered Fox, “go and say I have forgot
everything.” “No,” replied the King: “I have a
good opinion of you; you have abilities and honesty,
but you are too warm. I will send a common
friend, Lord Waldegrave.” He told him too, “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
have obligations to you that I never mentioned; my
son (the Prince) tried you, and you would not join
him; and yet you made no merit of it to me.”</p>

<p>The negotiation was entrusted to Lord Waldegrave:
Stone, probably from perceiving that Murray
dared not undertake the rudder of the House of
Commons, promoted the treaty&mdash;and did himself
no service with the Princess, who prevailed on Lord
Egmont to accept, and on the King to offer him an
employment. The Junto, who had laboured to keep
Pitt and Fox disunited, more than to secure either
of them, were reduced to take the one or the other.
The Chancellor had discovered so much of the
secret of his breast, as to ask Pitt, “Could you
bear to act <em>under</em> Fox?” Pitt replied, “My Lord,
leave out <em>under</em>; it will never be a word between
us; Mr. Fox and I shall never quarrel.” Originally,
Pitt had assured the Chancellor and the Duke of
Newcastle that he would not unite with Fox. When
he saw that to promote division was their only
drift, he sought heartily and sincerely to league
with Fox, and told him that they had <em>formalized</em>
at his professions.</p>

<p>Fox, irresolute, affecting content, borne down by
the Duke from opposition, and aspiring at sole
power, conferred with Pitt, but would not enter
into real measures. The King proposed that Fox
should write his demands: he asked for time, waiting
to see what should be their decision on Pitt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
who set them at defiance. The Duke of Marlborough
proposed to Fox, to limit his demands to a
Cabinet-Counsellor’s place, “For,” said he, “you
don’t mind money.” The Duke of Cumberland
disapproved the advice: “The King,” said his
Royal Highness, “could do better and more sensibly
than he will, but he will do just as the Duke
of Newcastle bids him. He has a good memory;
he will remember this; and when he sees a proper
occasion, perhaps some years hence, he will tell you
you did right&mdash;but he will never tell you so till he
sees that occasion. I don’t know him, but by what
you tell me, Pitt is, what is scarce&mdash;he is a man.
If they should give you this Cabinet-Counsellor’s
place, and Pitt should hereafter attack the Duke of
Newcastle, and you should not defend him, they
will say you have broke your word.”</p>

<p>The Duke of Marlborough persisted, but advised
Fox to add, that he would not oppose Pitt. The
Duke approved it with this modification. Fox
drew the letter, and showed it to Pitt, who liked it,
provided some words were omitted; “For,” said
he, “if they give a hint to invention that I would
do the least thing to keep my place, it would hurt
me beyond measure.” The letter thanked the King
for his goodness, and said, that understanding what
his Majesty, who was determined to have no Minister
at the head of the House of Commons, required,
was, that he (Fox) should act there with spirit, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
only in his private but public capacity, he, coveting
no lucrative employment, wished only for a
feather, to show that his Majesty had done him the
honour to ask his assistance. Cabinet-Counsellor
was not specified, but was construed to be meant,
by Lord Waldegrave, who delivered the letter, and
who explained to the King, that Fox would never
accept Pitt’s place, that it might not be objected to
him at his re-election, and that Pitt might not say
he answered him for money. He was ready to act
<em>under</em> Sir Thomas Robinson, “For,” said Fox,
laughing, “what is acting under <em>him</em>? if there is
a meeting of the Council, it will be his paper and
pens and his green table: if we both rise to speak,
I will yield to him.” Lord Waldegrave added, that
if Fox answered Pitt, it should always be in defence
of the measures, but with particular civility.
These qualifications were accepted, and the dignity
of Cabinet-Counsellor granted a few days afterwards.
Yet Fox, on receiving it, privately forswore
all connexion with Pitt. As the latter came
to the knowledge of that secret abjuration, and as
it was so much the interest of men so little scrupulous
of treachery as the Chancellor and the Duke
of Newcastle, to have Pitt apprized of it, it is
neither refining nor uncharitable to suspect who
divulged it.</p>

<p>The Mutiny Bill coming on, Mr. Fox had showed
Lord Egmont a new clause for subjecting the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
regiments to English discipline. He took it
as gravely as if he were still to oppose, though it
was public that he was to succeed the superannuated
Lord Fitzwalter, as Treasurer of the Household,
and, as he himself had said, by special command of
the Princess. The first day he did not attend.
December 11th, Oswald and Henley spoke for the
clause: Lord Egmont, struck with the old sounds,
and forgetting his new engagements, could not resist
the impulse of haranguing against a Mutiny
Bill. He rose, and spoke on his ancient topics of
military law, of massacre and butchery, and of all
he had foretold, and said, that everybody must be
sensible that, in the situation he stood, he must
have had grievances brought to him from every
part of the known world; and talked much on the
old constitution, the feudal law, and prerogative.
Pitt spoke after him, but gently, and not well;
Lord George Sackville well. Charles Townshend
(who had ambitioned the Treasury on the late settlement,
had stuck out for some time, and had then
accepted the Admiralty), hurt at a new promotion
over his head, started up, and not considering how
indecent it was in him, a little Minister, to discourage
renegades, fell with warmth and insolence
and eloquence on Lord Egmont; pointed out the
ridicule of a popular tribune speaking for prerogative,
and against revolution principles; then panegyrized
the Board of Trade, defended all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
acts, even the instructions to Sir Danvers Osborn;
and, turning again to Lord Egmont, bade him take
the poor American by the hand, and point out his
grievances; his Lordship was able, and used to be
willing to bring out grievances; he had threatened
he would; yet he defied him&mdash;if that would not do,
he beseeched him&mdash;to point out one grievance; for
his part, he did not know of one; he should be
glad to learn why his Lordship did not intend to
mention one <em>now</em>: and then, in the most provoking
manner, and in terms most intelligible, he attacked
him on the place he was going to accept. Lord
Egmont was abashed, replied with confusion, said
he might state grievances hereafter, but hoped
things were going to be redressed. He was over-powered
by the attack, and excused himself from
accepting the promised employment.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the year deceased two men
in great offices, whose deaths made remarked what
their lives might have done; how little they were
worthy of their exaltation. The one, Lord Gower,
Lord Privy Seal, had indeed a large fortune, and
commanded boroughs. Lord Albemarle, the other,
died suddenly at Paris, where his mistress sold him
to that Court. Yet the French Ministry had little
to vaunt; while they were purchasing the instructions
of our Embassador, attentive only to acquire
the emptiest of their accomplishments, they employed
at our Court a man too empty to learn even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
the dullest of ours. Lord Albemarle made great
proficience in the study of their manners, while
Monsieur de Mirepoix could not learn even to pronounce
the names of one or two of our games at
cards, which, however, engaged most of the hours
of his negotiation. Our Colonies were to be protected
by the copy of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Petit Maitre</i>; we were to
be bullied out of them by an apprentice to whist!
How serious a science, Politics!</p>

<p class="negin2 fs90"><em>Constitutional Queries, earnestly recommended to the serious
Consideration of every true Briton, dispersed in 1751, and
ascribed to Lord Egmont.</em></p>

<p>Whether this capital may not be beset with
troops, under such orders and commands, as may
render the power of King, Lords, and Commons
precarious; and subject our liberties, property, and
laws, once more, to a military regulation?</p>

<p>Whether, if alarm posts should be appointed,
places of rendezvous assigned, officers have the
word, not to be absent, though on no duty, without
express leave, and to hold themselves in readiness
on a moment’s warning, such regulations in time of
peace would not have a martial air, by no means
becoming the freedom of a British constitution?</p>

<p>Whether disgracing or dismissing old officers,
men of family, men of property, in order to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
way for the promotion of boys, slaves, and beggars,
would not be such a garbling of the Army, as might
furnish very melancholy apprehensions of its destination?</p>

<p>Whether such terrifying dispositions ought not
to alarm a free people; and might not with too
much reason induce them to apprehend, that the
time was approaching when some <em>important blow
was to be struck</em>?</p>

<p>Whether, if a <em>younger</em> son of the Crown should
ever be invested with absolute power over such an
Army; and, at the same time, by a factious connexion,
make himself master of the Fleet, our lives
and fortunes might not be dependent on his will
and pleasure, and the <em>Right of Succession</em> have
no other security than his want of ambition?</p>

<p>Whether adding to this dangerous degree of
power the sole direction of affairs in the Cabinet
likewise, might not give him such a dictatorial authority
as would enable him to expel from his
father’s Council and person every moderate Minister,
true Englishman, and old servant of the Crown,
who, though perhaps unable to prevent, might in
some measure delay, the execution of his designs?</p>

<p>Whether, during the time of peace, experiment
has not been actually made in one part of this
country (now under the cloud of prejudice) how
far an army may be depended on in usurping a
dominion over law?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether, if in any country express and positive
orders should be generally and circularly given by
authority to the troops to execute the law, to seize
and imprison the persons of the subjects, upon such
information as they should think sufficient, without
the concurrence of the civil power, such country
might not be deemed under a direct military
government in its rankest form?</p>

<p>Whether a successful attempt in one part of a
country would not furnish sanguine hopes of reducing
the remaining part to the like unconstitutional
dominion?</p>

<p>Whether the omnipotence of a commander, joined
with the faction, stupidity, and corruption of the
times, might not be able to stifle and baffle all
regular proof of such notorious acts of arbitrary
and tremendous power?</p>

<p>Whether it might not be prudent to reflect on
the fatal instances of John of Lancaster and crook-backed
Richard?</p>

<p>Whether an abused K&mdash;&mdash; and kingdom, liberty,
property, and the laws, do not all concur to
inspire this timely invocation?</p>

<p class="pfs90"><em>The following Queries are humbly offered to the serious consideration
of every True Englishman.</em></p>

<p>Whether it has not strongly appeared by the
late conduct of the House of Commons, that they
are more eager and industrious to create and to
foment the spirit of party and sedition, than to
promote the liberty and happiness of the people?</p>

<p>Whether the leaders of the House have not by open
force, as well as private fraud, endeavoured to
weaken and reduce even the appearance of a free
constitution?</p>

<p>Whether, in the case of Mr. Murray, the House
of Commons did not assume a power they had no
just right to?</p>

<p>Whether they did not proceed throughout in a
most illegal, unconstitutional, unprecedented manner?</p>

<p>Whether they did not try him upon an accusation
they knew to be false, scandalous, and
groundless?</p>

<p>Whether they did not condemn him in defiance
of all law, and in the most open violation of justice?</p>

<p>Whether their proceedings have not made a dangerous
encroachment upon the freedom and independency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
of the British people, as well as brought
a lasting dishonour upon the British Parliament?</p>

<p>Whether their daily conduct does not tend, instead
of remedying the distractions of a jarring
people, to throw them into a continued confusion,
and to make resentment and rebellion become
habitual to Britain?</p>

<p>Whether there is not reason to expect that we
shall soon be deprived of the most valuable right a
British subject can enjoy, the right of election?</p>

<p>Whether we are not bound upon the most conscientious
motives by any means in our power to
defend it?</p>

<p>Can we patiently look upon these fresh endeavours
to abuse and to divide the nation? can we patiently
bear fresh loads of oppression multiplied without
measure, and extended without limitation?</p>

<em>Note.</em>&mdash;[The following, which is styled “Brief account
of George Bubb Doddington, Lord Melcombe,”
is written in Horace Walpole’s printed
copy of the Diary; and as it contains some
traits of character, and other anecdotes of a
person who is often mentioned in the Memoirs,
and who has himself related many of the same
transactions, it is here subjoined to the work,
though no injunctions to that purport were left
by the author.]</div>

<p>George Bubb Doddington was son of an apothecary
at Carlisle, by a sister or near relation of Mr.
Doddington of Eastberry, in Dorsetshire, who bequeathed
him his estate and name, with obligation
to finish the vast seat at Eastberry, designed by
Vanbrugh; and which was pulled down by Richard
Grenville, first Earl Temple, on whom it was entailed,
in case of Bubb’s having no issue, as happened.
Doddington had a great deal of wit, great
knowledge of business, and was an able speaker in
Parliament, though an affected one, and though
most of his speeches were premeditated. He was,
as his diary shows, vain, fickle, ambitious, servile,
and corrupt. Early in his life, he had been devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
to Sir Robert Walpole, and in an epistle to him,
which Pope quotes, had professed himself,</p>

<p class="pfs80">In power a servant, out of power a friend.</p>

<p>At a much later period of life he published an
epistle to Lord Bute, whom he styled Pollio. Mr.
Wyndham, editor of his Diary, wrote to Dr. Joseph
Warton, in 1784, that he had found, among Doddington’s
papers, an old copy of that poem, <em>but inscribed
to Sir Robert Walpole</em>. He fell more than
once under the lash of Pope, who coupled him with
Sir William Yonge in this line&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfs80">The flowers of Bubbington and flow of Yonge.</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of Frederick Prince of
Wales in England, Doddington became a favourite,
and submitted to the Prince’s childish horse-play,
being once rolled up in a blanket, and trundled
down stairs; nor was he negligent in paying more
solid court, by lending his Royal Highness<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> money.
He was, however, supplanted, I think, by George,
afterwards Lord Lyttelton, and again became a
courtier and placeman at St. James’s; but once
more reverted to the Prince at the period where his
Diary commences. Pope was not the only poet
who diverted the town at Doddington’s expense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
Sir Charles Hanbury ridiculed him in a well-known
dialogue with Gyles Earle, and in a ballad entitled
“A Grub upon Bubb.” Dr. Young, on the contrary,
who was patronized by him, has dedicated to
him one of his satires on the love of fame, as Lyttelton
had inscribed one of his cantos on the progress
of love. Glover, and that prostitute fellow Ralph,
were also countenanced by him, as the Diary shows.</p>

<p>Doddington’s own wit was very ready. I will
mention two instances. Lord Sundon was Commissioner
of the Treasury with him and Winnington,
and was very dull. One Thursday, as they
left the board, Lord Sundon laughed heartily at
something Doddington said; and when gone, Winnington
said, “Doddington, you are very ungrateful;
you call Sundon stupid and slow, and yet you
see how quick he took what you said.” “Oh, no,”
replied Doddington, “he was only laughing now at
what I said last Treasury day.”&mdash;Mr. Trenchard, a
neighbour, telling him, that though his pinery was
expensive, he contrived, by applying the fire and
the dung to other purposes, to make it so advantageous,
that he believed he got a shilling by
every pine-apple he ate. “Sir,” said Doddington,
“I would eat them for half the money.”&mdash;Doddington
was married to a Mrs. Behan, whom he was
supposed to keep. Though secretly married, he
could not own her, as he then did, till the death of
Mrs. Strawbridge, to whom he had given a promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
of marriage, under the penalty of ten thousand
pounds. He had long made love to the latter, and,
at last, obtaining an assignation, found her lying
on a couch. However, he only fell on his knees,
and after kissing her hand for some time, cried out,
“Oh, that I had you but in a wood!” “In a wood!”
exclaimed the disappointed dame; “what would
you do then? Would you <em>rob</em> me?” It was on
this Mrs. Strawbridge that was made the ballad,</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">My Strawberry&mdash;my Strawberry</p>
<p class="verse2">Shall bear away the bell;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">to the burthen and tune of which Lord Bath, many
years afterwards, wrote his song on “Strawberry
Hill.”</p>

<p>Doddington had no children. His estate descended
to Lord Temple, whom he hated, as he did
Lord Chatham, against whom he wrote a pamphlet
to expose the expedition to Rochfort.</p>

<p>Nothing was more glaring in Doddington than
his want of taste, and the tawdry ostentation in his
dress and furniture of his houses. At Eastberry,
in the great bedchamber, hung with the richest red
velvet, was pasted, on every panel of the velvet, his
crest (a hunting-horn supported by an eagle) cut out
of gilt leather. The foot-cloth round the bed was
a mosaic of the pocket-flaps and cuffs of all his embroidered
clothes. At Hammersmith<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> his crest, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
pebbles, was stuck into the centre of the turf before
his door. The chimney-piece was hung with spars
representing icicles round the fire, and a bed of
purple, lined with orange, was crowned by a dome
of peacock’s feathers. The great gallery, to which
was a beautiful door of white marble, supported by
two columns of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapis lazuli</i>, was not only filled
with busts and statues, but had, I think, an inlaid
floor of marble; and all this weight was above
stairs.</p>

<p>One day showing it to Edward, Duke of York,
Doddington said, “Sir, some persons tell me that
this room ought to be on the ground.” “Be easy,
Mr. Doddington,” replied the Prince, “it will soon
be there.”</p>

<p>In the approach to his villa at Hammersmith,
Mr. Doddington erected a noble obelisk, surmounted
by an urn of bronze, to the memory of his wife,
who died before him. Mr. Wyndham, his heir,
took down the obelisk, and sold it. The Diary was
certainly not published entire. A gentleman, who
saw it five years before it was published, missed
some particular passages.&mdash;H. W., June 7th, 1784.</p>

<p>Another instance of Doddington’s wit. Doddington
was very lethargic: falling asleep one day, after
dinner, with Sir Richard Temple, Lord Cobham,
the General, the latter reproached Doddington
with his drowsiness; Doddington denied having
been asleep, and to prove he had not, offered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
repeat all Lord Cobham had been saying. Cobham
challenged him to do so. Doddington repeated a
story, and Lord Cobham owned he had been telling
it. “Well,” said Doddington, “and yet I did not
hear a word of it; but I went to sleep because I
knew that about this time of day you would tell
that story.” <span class="nowrap">* * * *</span></p>

<p>Henrietta, daughter of Sir Henry Hobart, was
first married to Colonel Henry Howard, afterwards
Earl of Suffolk, by whom she had an only son,
Henry, who succeeded his father, but died a young
man. Mr. Howard and she travelled in very mean
circumstances to Hanover before the accession of
that family to the Crown; and after it, she was
made a Woman of the Bedchamber to the Princess;
and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'being confidente of'">being <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confidante</i> of</ins> the Prince’s passion for a
lady, who was in love with, and soon after privately
married to, a Colonel, Mrs. Howard had the address
to divert the channel of his inclination to
herself. Her husband bore it very ill, and attempted
to force her from St. James’s, but was at last
quieted with a pension of 1200<em>l.</em> per annum. Yet
Mrs. Howard had little interest with the King.
The Queen persecuted whoever courted her; and
Sir R. Walpole directing all his worship to the uncommonly-powerful
wife, Mrs. Howard naturally
became his enemy, and as naturally attached herself
to Lord Bolingbroke; the more intimate connexion
of which intercourse, carelessly concealed
by a mistress that was tired, and eagerly hunted
out by a wife still jealous, was unravelled by the
Princess Emily at the Bath, and at last laid open
by the cautious Queen; the King stormed; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
mistress was glad he did, left him in his moods, and
married George Berkeley, brother to the late Earl,
by whom she was again left a widow in 1746.</p>

<p>King George the Second has often, when Mrs.
Howard, his mistress, was dressing the Queen,
come into the room, and snatched the handkerchief
off, and cried, “Because you have an ugly neck
yourself, you love to hide the Queen’s!” Her
Majesty (all the while calling her “<em>My good
Howard</em>,”) took great joy in employing her in the
most servile offices about her person. The King
was so communicative to his wife, that one day
Mrs. Selwyn, another of the Bedchamber Women,
told him he should be the last man with whom
she would have an intrigue, because he always told
the Queen. Their letters, whenever he was at
Hanover, were so long, that he has complained
when she has written to him but nineteen pages;
and in his, at the beginning of his amour with
Lady Yarmouth, he frequently said, “I know you
will love the Walmoden, <em>because she loves me</em>.”
Old Blackbourn, the Archbishop of York, told her
one day, “That he had been talking to her Minister
Walpole about the new mistress, and was glad to
find that her Majesty was so sensible a woman as
to like her husband should divert himself.” Yet
with the affectation of content, it made her most
miserable: she dreaded Lady Yarmouth’s arrival,
and repented not having been able to resist the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
temptation of driving away Lady Suffolk the first
instant she had an opportunity, though a rival so
powerless, and so little formidable. The King was
the most regular man in his hours: his time of
going down to Lady Suffolk’s apartment was seven
in the evening: he would frequently walk up and
down the gallery, looking at his watch, for a quarter
of an hour before seven, but would not go till the
clock struck.</p>

<p>The King had another <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passager amour</i> (between
the disgrace of Lady Suffolk and the arrival
of Lady Yarmouth) with the Governess to the two
youngest Princesses; a pretty idiot, with most of
the vices of her own sex, and the additional one of
ours, drinking. Yet this thing of convenience, on
the arrival of Lady Yarmouth, put on all that
dignity of passion, which even revolts real inclination.</p>

<p class="pfs90"><em>Extracts from Letters of Sir Charles Hanbury Williams,

<p class="p2 pfs60">TO THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE.</p>

<p class="right fs80">Berlin, July 11-22nd, 1750.</p>

<p>.... Count Podewils’s behaviour to me
has been hitherto very cold, and when I meet him
at third places, he contents himself with making
me a bow, without speaking to me.</p>

<p>I have made one visit to Monsieur Finkenstein,
who is the second Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs. He has very much the air of a French
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit-maître manqué</i>, and is extremely affected in
everything he says and does: but from what I have
been able hitherto to learn, his credit with the King
of Prussia increases daily; and that of Count Podewils
is not thought to be so good as it formerly
was. The former has lately gained a point over
the latter: Count Podewils’s kinsman, who is at
Vienna, was named to be a Minister of State before
Count Finkenstein; but Count Finkenstein has got
into his employment, and when Count Podewils returns
from Vienna, Count Finkenstein will take
place of him. Not that his Prussian Majesty gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
entire confidence either to Podewils or Finkenstein;
he reserves that for two persons that constantly reside
with him at Potsdam, and whose names are Heichel
and Fredersdorff; the first of whom is his Prussian
Majesty’s Private Secretary, and who is always
kept under the same roof with his Prussian Majesty,
and is so well watched, that a person may be at this
Court seven years without once seeing him. The
other, who is the great favourite, was once a common
soldier, and the King took a fancy to him, while he
was yet Prince Royal of Prussia, as he was standing
sentinel at the door of his apartment. This person
has two very odd titles joined together, for he is
styled <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de chambre</i>, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand tresorier du
Roi</i>. He keeps out of all people’s sight as much
as Heichel.</p>

<p>But there is lately arose another young man,
who has undoubtedly a large share in the King of
Prussia’s favours: his name is Sedoo: he was not
long ago his page, then came to be a lieutenant,
and is very lately made a major, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premier
ecuyer de l’ecurie de Potsdam</i>, and will undoubtedly
soon rise much higher.</p>


<p class="p2 pfs90"><em>Another Extract.</em></p>

<p>.... On Thursday, by appointment, I
went to Court at eleven o’clock; the King of Prussia
arrived about twelve, and Count Podewils immediately
introduced me into his closet, where I delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
his Majesty’s letters into the King of Prussia’s
hands, and made the usual compliments to him in
the best manner I was able. To which his Prussian
Majesty replied, to the best of my remembrance, as
follows: “I have the truest esteem for the King of
Great Britain’s person, and I set the highest value
upon his friendship. I have at different times
received essential proofs of it; and I desire you
would acquaint the King, your master, that I will
never forget them.” His Prussian Majesty afterwards
said something with respect to myself, and
then asked me several questions about indifferent
things and persons. He seemed to express a great
deal of esteem for my Lord Chesterfield, and a great
deal of kindness for Mr. Villiers, but did not once
mention Lord Hyndford, or Mr. Legge. I was
in the closet with his Majesty exactly five minutes
and a half.</p>

<p>After my audience was over, the King of Prussia
came out into that room where the Foreign Ministers
wait for his Prussian Majesty. He just said
one word to Count de la Puebla (the Austrian
Minister) as he came in, and afterwards addressed
his discourse to the French, Swedish, and Danish
Ministers; but did not say one word either to the
Russian Minister or myself.</p>

<p class="p2 pfs90"><em>Extract from another Letter, in Cipher.</em></p>

<p class="right fs80">Berlin July, 28, 1750.</p>

<p>.... About four days ago, Mr. Voltaire,
the French poet, arrived at Potsdam from Paris.
The King of Prussia had wrote to him about three
months ago to desire him to come to Berlin. Mr.
Voltaire answered his Prussian Majesty, that he
should always be glad of an opportunity of throwing
himself at his Majesty’s feet, but at that time he
was not in circumstances to take so long a journey;
upon which the King of Prussia sent him back
word, that he would bear his expenses; but Mr.
Voltaire, not caring to trust the King of Prussia,
would not leave Paris till his Prussian Majesty had
sent him a bill of exchange upon a banker in that
town for 4000 rix-dollars, and he did not begin the
journey till he had actually received the money.

<p class="negin2">[The following extracts from the private correspondence

further illustrate the remark in the text, and
show the unfavourable view taken by him of the

Berlin, 1750.</em></p>

<p>.... ’Tis incredible what care this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater
Patriæ</i> takes of his people. He is so good as to
meddle in their family affairs, in their marriages,
in the education of their children, and in the disposition
of their estates. He hates that anybody
should marry, especially an officer, let him be of
what degree soever, and from the moment they take
a wife, they are sure of never being preferred. All
children are registered as soon as born, and the parents
are obliged to produce either certificates of
their deaths, or the male children themselves, at the
age of fourteen, in order to be enrolled, and to take
the oath of a soldier to the King; and if this is not
done, or the children have escaped, the parents are
answerable for the escape, and are sent to prison.</p>

<p>No man can sell land throughout all the Prussian
dominions without a special licence from the King:
and as he does no more give licences, nobody can
now dispose of or alienate his possessions. If they
could, and were to find fools to purchase them, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
believe he would not have ten of his present subjects
left in a year’s time. They have really no
liberty left but that of thinking. There is a general
constraint that runs through all sorts of people, and
diffidence is painted in every face. All their ambition
and desire is to be permitted to go to their
Country Seats, where they need not be obliged to
converse with any but their own family. But this
leave is not easily obtained, because the father of
his country insists upon their living at Berlin,
and making his Capital flourish. He is never here
but from the beginning of December to the end of
January, and during that time, Prussians, Silesians,
and all his most distant subjects, are obliged to
come and make a figure here, and spend all they
have been saving for the other ten months. He
hates that any subject of his should be rich or easy;
and if he lives a few years longer, he will have
accomplished his generous design. There are actually
but four persons in this great town that live
upon their own means, and they are people that
can’t last long in their present condition.</p>

<p>He (always meaning <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater Patriæ</i>) gives very
small salaries to all employments, and this is the
cause that he can get no gentleman to serve him in

Court is such, as I wonder how Sovereign Princes
can bear. Of this, if I had time, I could give you
many provoking instances. His Prussian Majesty’s
Ministers at Berlin&mdash;I mean those for Foreign Affairs&mdash;make
the oddest figure of any in Europe. They
seldom or never see any dispatches that are sent to
the Prussian Ministers at Foreign Courts; and all
letters that come to Berlin from Foreign Courts go
directly to the King; so that Mr. Podewils and
Count Finkenstein know no more of what passes in
Europe than what they are informed of by the
Gazettes. When any of us go to them on any business,
the surprise they are in easily betrays their ignorance,
and the only answer you ever get is, that
they will lay what you say before their master, and
give you an answer as soon as he shall have signified
his pleasure to them. When you return to
their houses for this answer, they tell you the exact
words which the king has directed, and never one
word more; nor are you permitted to argue any
point. In short, they act the part of Ministers
without being really so, as much as ever Cibber did
that of Wolsey upon the stage, only not half so
well.</p>

<p>The first of them is reputed to be an honest man,
but he is nothing less. He loses that appearance
of credit he once had, daily; for verily I believe he
never had real weight enough with his master to
have made an Ensign in his Army, or a Postillion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
in one of his Posthouses. His face is the picture
of Dullness when she smiles, and his figure is a
mixture of a clown and a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit-maître</i>. He is a
little genteeler than Mons. Adrié, who you may remember
to have seen make so great a figure in
England.</p>

<p>The other, Count Finkenstein, whom everybody
calls Count Fink, is very like the late Lord Hervey,
and yet his face is the ugliest I ever saw. But
when he speaks, his affectation, the motion of his
eyes and shoulders, all his different gestures and
grimaces, bring Lord Hervey very strongly into my
mind; and, like that Lord, he is the Queen’s favourite
(I mean the Queen Mother’s); and her Majesty,
whether seriously or otherwise I can’t tell, calls him
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon beau Comte Fink</i>.” He has parts, and is
what, at Berlin, is called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sçavant</i>, which is to say,
that he has read all the modern French story books,
from <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Egaremens</cite> down to the history of <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Prince
Cocquetron</cite>.</p>

<p>The person who has certainly the greatest share
of the King of Prussia’s confidence is one Heichel.
He is his Private Secretary, and writes all that the
King himself dictates. But this man I never saw, and
people that have lived here seven years have never
seen him. He is kept like a State Prisoner, is in
constant waiting, and never has half an hour to
himself in the whole year.</p>

<p>[Then follows the account of Fredersdorff, to the
same purpose, and nearly in the same words as in
the extracts printed above.]</p>

<p>He (Fredersdorff) is his Secretary for all small
affairs for his Prussian Majesty.&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfs80"><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il fait tout par ses mains, et voit tout par ses yeux.</span></p>

<p>If a Courier is to be dispatched to Versailles, or
a Minister to Vienna, his Prussian Majesty draws,
himself, the instructions for the one, and writes the
letters for the other. This, you’ll say, is great;
but if a Dancer at the Opera has disputes with a
Singer, or if one of those performers want a new
pair of stockings, a plume for his helmet, or a
finer petticoat, ’tis the same King of Prussia that
sits in judgment on the cause, and that with his
own hand answers the Dancer’s or the Singer’s
letter. His Prussian Majesty laid out 20,000<em>l.</em> to
build a fine theatre, and his music and Singers cost
him near the same sum every year; yet this same
King, when an opera is performed, wont allow ten
pounds per night to light up the theatre with wax
candles; and the smoke that rises from the bad oil,
and the horrid stink that flows from the tallow,
make many of the audience sick, and actually spoil
the whole entertainment. What I have thought
about this Prince is very true; and I believe, after
reading what I say about him, you will think so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
too. <em>He is great in great things, and little in little
ones.</em></p>

<p>In the summer 1749, three Prussian Officers
came, without previously asking leave, to see a
Review of some Austrian troops in Moravia; upon
which the Commanding Officer of those troops,
suspecting they were not come so much out of
curiosity to see the Review, as to debauch some of
the soldiers into the King of Prussia’s service, sent
them orders to retire. This being reported to his
Prussian Majesty, he was much offended, and resolved
to take some method to show his resentment,
which he did as follows:&mdash;Last summer, an Austrian
Captain, being in the Duchy of Mecklenburgh, met
there with an old acquaintance, one Chapeau, who
is in great favour with the King of Prussia. At
that time, there was to be a great Review at Berlin,
and as Berlin was in the Austrian’s road in his return
to Vienna, Chapeau invited him to see the
Review; but the Austrian replied, that he would
willingly come, but was afraid of receiving some
affront, in return for what had been done to the
Prussian Officers the year before in Moravia; to
which Chapeau replied, that if he would come to
Berlin, he would undertake to get the King of
Prussia’s special leave for him to be present at the
Review. Encouraged by this, the Austrian came,
and the night before the Review, Chapeau brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
him word that the leave was granted, and he might
come with all safety. He did accordingly come;
but as soon as the King of Prussia had notice of his
being there, he sent an Aide-de-camp to him to tell
him to retire that moment, which he was forced to
do, not without much indignation against Chapeau,
who had drawn him into the scrape. The next
morning he went to Chapeau, with an intention to
demand satisfaction for the affront which, through
him, he had received. Chapeau said he would do
as he pleased, but first desired him to give him leave
to speak for himself; which he did. Chapeau then
told him, that immediately upon hearing that he
had been sent out of the field in that strange manner,
he had rode up to the King, and asked his Majesty
whether he had not given him orders to tell the
Austrian Officer that he might come to the Review
with all security? and that the King had replied, it
was very true, he had given such orders; because,
if he had not, the Austrian would hardly have ventured
to come to the Review; and if he had not
come there, he (the King) should not have had an
opportunity of revenging the affront that had been
offered to some Officers of his own the year before
in Moravia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I must tell you a story of the King of Prussia’s
regard for the law of nations. There was, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
time ago, a Minister here from the Duke of Brunswick,
whose name was Hoffman. He was a person
of very good sense, and what we call well-intentioned,
(which means being attached to the interests
of the maritime powers and the House of Austria.)
He was, besides, very active and dexterous in getting
intelligence, which he constantly communicated to
the Ministers of England and Austria. This the
King of Prussia being well informed of, wrote a
letter with his own hand to the Duke of Brunswick,
to insist (and in case of refusal to threaten) that
he should absolutely disavow Hoffman for his Minister.
The Duke, who is the worthiest Prince
upon earth, was so frightened with this letter, that
he complied, though much against his will, with
this haughty and cruel request. The moment the
King of Prussia received this answer, he sent a
party of Guards to Hoffman’s house, seized him,
sent him prisoner to Madgeburgh, where he has now
been for above four years chained to a wheel-barrow,
and working at the fortifications of that town!
He was very near doing the same by a Minister of
the Margravine of Anspach’s, but that person got
timely notice, and escaped out of Berlin in the
morning; and when the King of Prussia’s Guards
came to seize him at night, the bird had luckily
flown.</p>

<p>There is at present here a Minister of the Duke of
Brunswick, the successor of Hoffman, to whom, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
his first audience, the King said, that he advised
him to act very differently from his predecessor,
and particularly to take care not to frequent those
Foreign Ministers that he must know were disagreeable
to him; for if he did, he might depend upon
it he should deal with him in the same manner as
he had done with Hoffman.</p>

<p>I think Hamlet says in the play, “Denmark is
a prison;” the whole Prussian territory is so in the
literal sense of the word. No man can, or does
pretend to go out of it without the knowledge of
the King and his Ministers. Very hard is the fate
of those who have estates in other dominions besides
those of his Prussian Majesty; he will neither
permit them to sell their estates in his countries,
nor live upon those they have out of them. The
distresses which are come on the Silesians (who had
estates also in Bohemia) are prodigious. Many people
have given them up, or sold them for a trifle, to get
out of this land of Egypt&mdash;this house of bondage.
Six hundred dollars make just one hundred guineas,
and I know the King of Prussia thinks that just
as much as any of his subjects ought to have, exclusive
of what he may give them. In a very few
years, I am convinced that no subject of his that
has not estates elsewhere will have more left him.
But from what he has already done, he begins to
find that it is no longer possible to collect the heavy
taxes which he imposes on his subjects. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
that the revenues of all his countries, except Silesia,
have diminished every year, for these last five
years.</p>

<p>A Prussian will tell you, with a very grave face,
that their present King is the most merciful Prince
that ever reigned, and that he hates shedding blood.
This is not true; there are often as cruel and tormenting
executions in this country as ever were
known under any Sicilian tyrant. ’Tis true, they
are not done at Berlin, nor in the face of the world,
but at Potsdam, in private. Since my arrival in
this cursed country, an old woman was quartered
alive at Potsdam, for having assisted two soldiers
to desert. But his Prussian Majesty generally
punishes offenders with close imprisonment and very
hard labour, keeping them naked in the coldest
weather, and giving them nothing, for years together,
but bread and water. Such mercy is cruelty.
Many persons destroy themselves here out of mere
despair; but all imaginable care is taken to conceal
such suicides. I have heard of one of our Governors
in the Indies, who was reproached by his friends,
on his return to England, that he put a great number
of persons to death; to which that humane Governor
replied, “It is not true; I only used them so ill,
that they hanged themselves.” <span class="nowrap">* * *</span></p>

<p>Though poetry was certainly neither a point of
their rivalship, nor of their ambition, it may not be
unwelcome to the curious to compare these great
men even in their poetic capacities. The following
sonnet was written by Sir R. Walpole when a very
young man; the elegy, by Lord Bolingbroke, rather
past his middle age. Had they climbed no mountain
but Parnassus, it is obvious how far Lord
Bolingbroke would have ascended above his competitor,
since, when turned of fifty, he excelled in
the province of youth.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
